INTRODUCTION 

The User's Manual is one of four manuals that constitute the documentation for NASTRAN, the 
other three being the Theoretical Manual, the Programmer's Manual and the Demonstration Problem 
Manual. Although the User's Manual contains all of the information that is directly associated 
with the solution of problems with NASTRAN, the user will find it desirable to refer to the other 
manuals for assistance in the solution of specific user problems. 

The Theoretical Manual gives an excellent introduction to NASTRAN and presents developments of 
the analytical and numerical procedures that underlie the program. The User's Manual is 
instructive and encyclopedic in nature, but is restricted to those items related to the use of 
NASTRAN that are generally independent of the computing system being used. Computer-dependent 
topics and information that is required for the maintenance and modification of the program are 
treated in the Programmer's Manual. The Programmer's Manual also provides a complete description 
of the program, including the mathematical equations implemented in the code. The Demonstration 
Problem Manual presents a discussion of the sample problems delivered with NASTRAN, thereby 
illustrating the formulation of the different types of problems that can be solved with NASTRAN. 

In addition to the four manuals described above, there is also a NASTRAN User's Guide that 
serves as a handbook for users. It describes all of the NASTRAN features and options and 
illustrates them by examples. Other excellent sources for NASTRAN-related topics are the 
proceedings of the NASTRAN Users' Colloquia (held normally eyery year) which provide a large body 
of information based on user experiences with NASTRAN. 

The User's Manual has recently been completely revised and updated. With a view to facilitate 
easier updating of the manual in the future to keep up with newer releases of NASTRAN, it has now 
been divided into two volumes. 

Volume I consists of seven sections and contains all of the material that was in the old 
single volume, except Section 3. This section has been re-arranged into four sections and forms 
Volume II. In order to avoid confusion, Section 3 of Volume I does not contain anything other than 
a reference to the new Volume II. Also, it should be noted here that, unless explicitly indicated 
otherwise, all references to sections in each volume refer only to sections in that volume . 

NASTRAN uses the finite element approach to structural modeling, wherein the distributed 
physical properties of a structure are represented by a finite number of structural elements which 
are interconnected at a finite number of grid points, to which loads are applied and for which 
displacements are" calculated. The procedures for defining and loading a structural model are 



i (05/30/86) 



described in Volume I, Section 1. This section contains a functional reference for every card that 
is used for structural modeling. 

The NASTRAN Data Deck, including the details for each of the data cards, is described in 
Volume I, Section 2. This section also discusses the NASTRAN control cards that are associated 
with the use of the program. 

As mentioned earlier, Volume I, Section 3 does not contain anything other than a reference to 
Volume II. 

The procedures for using the NASTRAN plotting capability are described in Volume I, Section 4, 
Both deformed and undeformed plots of the structural model are available. Response curves are also 
available for static, transient response, frequency response, modal flutter and modal aeroelastic 
response analyses. 

NASTRAN contains problem solution sequences, called rigid formats. Each of these rigid 
formats is associated with the solution of problems for a particular type of static or dynamic 
analysis. In addition to the rigid format procedures, the user may choose to write his own Direct Matrix 
Abstraction Program (DMAP). This procedure permits the user to execute a series of matrix 
operations of his choice along with any utility modules or executive operations that he may need. 
The rules governing the creation of DMAP programs are described in Volume I, Section 5. 

The NASTRAN diagnostic messages are documented and explained in Volume I, Section 6. The 
NASTRAN Dictionary, in Volume I, Section 7, contains descriptions of mnemonics, acronyms, phrases, 
and other commonly used NASTRAN terms. 

Volume II, Section 1 contains a general description of rigid format procedures. Specific 
instructions and information for the use of each rigid format are given in Volume II, Sections 2, 3 
and 4, which deal with the rigid formats associated with the DISPLACEMENT, HEAT and AER0 
approaches, respectively. 

There is a limited number of sample problems included in the User's Manual. However, a more 
comprehensive set of demonstration problems,, at least one for each of the rigid formats, is 
described in the NASTRAN Demonstration Problem Manual. The data decks are available on tape for 
each of the computer systems on which NASTRAN has been implemented. Samples of the printer output 
and of structure plots and response plots can be obtained by executing these demonstration 
problems. The printer output for these problems is also available on microfiche.

1. RIGID FORMATS 

1.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

The most general way of using NASTRAN is with a user-written Direct Matrix Abstraction 
Program (DMAP). This procedure permits the user to execute a series of matrix operations of his 
choice along with any utility modules or executive operations that he may need. The user may even 
choose to write a module of his own. The rules governing all of these operations are described in 
Volume I, Section 5. 

In order to relieve the user of the necessity of constructing a DMAP sequence for each of his 
problems, a number of such sequences, called rigid formats, have been included with NASTRAN. All 
of these rigid formats are resident on a data base called the Rigid Format Data Base, which is 
described in detail in Section 1.1.7. Each rigid format in this data base consists of a DMAP 
sequence and the associated restart tables. These restart tables are automatically used by the 
program to modify the series of DMAP operations to account for any changes that are made in any 
part of the Data Deck when making a restart, after having previously run all, or a part, of the 
problem. Without such tables, the user would have to carefully modify his DMAP sequence to account 
for the conditions surrounding each restart. The chances for error in making these modifications 
for restart are very great. The restart tables not only relieve the user of the burden of 
modifying his DMAP sequence, but also assure him of a correct and efficient program execution. 

In addition to the DMAP sequence provided with each rigid format, a number of options are 
available, which are subsets of each complete DMAP sequence. Subsets are selected by specifying 
the subset numbers (zero for the complete DMAP sequence) along with the rigid format number on the 
S0L card in the Executive Control Deck. See the description of the S0L card in Volume I, Section 

2.2 for the list of available subsets. 

If the user wishes to modify the DMAP sequence of a rigid format in some manner not provided 
for in the available subsets, he can use the ALTER feature described in Section 2.2. Typical uses 
are to schedule an EXIT prior to completion, in order to check intermediate output, schedule the 
printing of a table or a matrix for diagnostic purposes, and to delete or add a functional module 
to the DMAP sequence. (The manner in which DMAP ALTERS are handled in restarts is discussed in 
Section 1.1.5.) The user should be familiar with the rules for DMAP programming, as described in 
Volume I, Section 5, prior to making ALTERs to a rigid format.

1.1.1 Input File Processor 

The Input File Processor operates in the Preface prior to the execution of the DMAP 
operations in the rigid format. A complete description of the operations in the Preface is given 
in the Programmer's Manual. The main interest here is to indicate the source of data blocks that 
are created in the Preface and hence appear only as inputs in the DMAP sequences of the rigid 
formats. None of the data blocks created by the Input File Processor are checkpointed, as they are 
always regenerated on restart. The Input File Processor is divided into five parts. The first 
part (IFP1) processes the Case Control Deck, the second part (IFP) processes the Bulk Data Deck, 

1.1-2 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

the third part (IFP3) performs additional processing of the bulk data cards associated with the 
conical shell element, and the fourth part (IFP4) performs additional processing of the bulk. data 
cards associated with the fluid element. The fifth section (IFP5) processes data related to 
acoustic cavity analysis. 

IFP1 processes the Case Control Deck and creates the Case Control Data Block (CASECC), the 
Plot Control Data Block (PCDB), and the XY-Plot Control Data Block (XYCDB). IFP1 also examines all 
of the cards, except those associated with plotting, for errors in format or use. If errors are 
detected, they are classed as either fatal or warning, and suitable error messages are provided. 
Reference to Volume I, Section 2.3 will assist the user in correcting errors in the Case Control 
Deck. If the error is fatal, the Executive System will not allow the execution to continue beyond 
the completion of the Preface. 

The Bulk Data Deck is sorted in the Preface, if necessary, before the execution of the second 
part of the Input File Processor. IFP checks all of the bulk, data cards for errors according to 
the rules given for each card in Volume I, Section 2.4. If errors are detected, suitable messages 
are provided to the user. If the error is classed as fatal, the Executive System will not allow 
the execution to continue beyond the completion of the Preface. IFP creates the data blocks that 
are input to the various part of the Geometry Processor (GE0M1, GE0M2, GE0M3 and GE0M4), the 
Element Properties Table (EPT), the Material Properties Table (MPT), the Element Deformation Table 
(EDT), and the Direct Input Table (DIT). 

The third part of the Input File Processor (IFP3) converts the information on the special 
conical shell cards (CC0NEAX, CTRAPAX, CTRIAAX, F0RCEAX, M0MAX, MPCAX, 0MITAX, PC0NEAX, P0INTAX, 
PRESAX, PTRAPAX, PTRfAAX, RINGAX, SECTAX, SPCAX, SUPAX, and TEMPAX) to reflect the number of 
harmonics specified by the user on the AXIC card. This converted information is added to any 
existing information on data blocks GE0M1, GE0M2, GE0M3 and GE0M4. 

The fourth part of the input file processor (IFP4) converts the information on the fluid- 
related cards (AXIF, BDYLIST, CFLUID2, CFLUID3, CFLUID4, DMIAX, FLSYM, FREEPT, FSLIST, GRIDB, 
PRESPT, and RINGFL) to reflect the desired harmonics, boundaries, and matrix input. This converted 
information is added to GE0M1, GE0M2, GE0M4 and MATP00L. 

The fifth part of the input file processor (IFP5) converts the information on the acoustic 
cavity related cards (AXSL0T, CAXIF2, CAXIF3, CAXIF4, CSL0T3, CSL0T4, GRIDF, GRIDS, and SLBDY) to 
equivalent structural scalar points, elements, scalar springs and plotting elements. This 
converted information is added to the GE0M1 and GE0M2 data blocks.

1.1.2 Functional Modules and Supporting DMAP Operations 

The DMAP listings of the rigid formats currently included with NASTRAN are presented in the 
following sections. Following each listing are subsections that deal with the following items for 
each rigid format: 

1. Brief description of important DMAP operations for the rigid format 

2. Output available from the rigid format 

3. Case Control Deck setup for the rigid format 

4. Parameters used in the rigid format 

5. Automatic ALTERs for Automated Multi -Stage Substructuring (if applicable to the rigid 
format) 

6. Rigid format error messages 

7. Any other features peculiar to the rigid format 

Descriptions of all major functional modules are given in the Programmer's Manual. 
Additional information is also given in the Theoretical Manual. Descriptions of all other NASTRAN 
modules are given in Volume I, Section 5. 

The modules in the following list appear repeatedly in the rigid formats. Since the purpose 
of these operations in a rigid format is obvious, they are generally omitted from the descriptions 
of the DMAP operations in the following sections. More complete descriptions of these modules are 
given in Volume I, Section 5. 

1. BEGIN indicates the beginning of the DMAP sequence constituting the rigid format. 

2. END indicates the end of the DMAP sequence constituting the rigid format and causes a 
normal termination when executed. 

3. FILE makes declarations relative to a particular file. 

ABC = TAPE states that file ABC will be assigned as a sequential file. 

DEF = APPEND states that file DEF may be extended as the result of an internal loop 
in the rigid format. 

GHI = SAVE states that file GHI should not be dropped after use as it may be needed 
for subsequent executions of an internal loop. 

4. LABEL specifies a labeled point in the sequence of DMAP instructions. Labels are 
referenced by REPT, JUMP and C0ND instructions. 

5. PARAM performs specified operations on integer DMAP parameters. 

6. PRECHK actuates the automatic generation of explicit CHKPNT instructions. (PRECHK ALL 
immediately and automatically CHKPNTs all output data blocks from each functional module, 
all data blocks mentioned in each PURGE instruction and all secondary data blocks in each 
EQUIV instruction.)* The CHKPNT instruction specifies a list of files to be written on 



* The only exceptions to this are the CASESS, CASEI and CASECC data blocks appearing as 
output in substructure analyses.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

the new problem tape (NPTP), including files that may have been purged, either because 
they were not generated in this particular execution or were explicitly purged with a 
PURGE instruction. * 

7. PURGE specifies the names of files that are conditionally dropped based on the parameter 
named. 



1.1.3 Checkpoint/Restart Procedures 

The checkpoint/restart feature available in NASTRAN is a very sophisticated and useful 
capability. The purpose of this feature is to enable a user to checkpoint a NASTRAN run and then 
restart it (with or without changes in data) by executing only those modules that need to be 
executed for the restart. 

There are several situations in which the use of the checkpoint/restart feature may be 
desirable. Some of these are listed below: 

1. The user may wish to perform his analysis task in two or more stages by specifying 
scheduled exits in one or more runs. 

2. The user may want to ensure that unscheduled exits (resulting from such causes as data 
errors, insufficient time s insufficient core or hardware failures) will not require him 
to repeat his entire analysis. 

3. The user may wish to rerun his problem by making limited changes in his data. 
Scheduled exits can be requested at any point in a rigid format by means of the ALTER 

feature. (The manner in which ALTERS are handled in restarts is discussed in Section 1.1.5). An 
exit is scheduled by inserting the following cards in the Executive Control Deck: 

ALTER Kl $ 

EXIT K2 $ 

ENDALTER $ 

where Kl = DMAP statement number after which exit will take place 

and K2 = Number of times EXIT instruction will be skipped before being executed - default is 
zero. For use with loops, where the user wishes to execute the loop K2 times before 
scheduling the exit. 

If the user chooses to restart the problem without making any changes, the Executive System will 

execute an unmodified restart following the last completed checkpoint. 

Unscheduled exits are usually caused by errors on input cards or errors in the structural 

model resulting from missing or inconsistent input data. When such errors are detected, an 

unscheduled exit is performed accompanied with the output of the applicable user error messages. 

Following the correction of the input data errors, a modified restart can be performed. 



1.1-5 (05/30/86) 



RIGID FORMATS 

Unscheduled exits may also occur because of machine failure or insufficient time allowance. 
In these cases, an unmodified restart is usually made following the last completed checkpoint. In 
some cases, where a portion of the problem has been completed, including the output for the 
completed portion, a modified restart must be made following an unscheduled exit due to 
insufficient time allowance. These situations are discussed under Case Control Deck requirements 
in the sections dealing with the individual rigid formats. 

The initial execution of any problem must be made with a complete NASTRAN Data Deck, 
including all of the bulk data. However, all or part of the bulk data may be assembled from 
alternate input sources, such as the User's Master File or a module written by the user to generate 
input. The User's Master File is described in Volume I, Section 2.5 and user generated input is 
discussed in Volume I, Section 2.6. 

For restarts, the Bulk Data Deck consists only of delete cards (see Volume I, Section 2.4) 
and new cards which the user wishes to add. The previous Bulk Data Deck is read from the Old 
Problem Tape. All other parts of the NASTRAN Data Deck, including the Executive Control Deck, the 
Case Control Deck, the BEGIN BULK card and the ENDDATA card must be resubmitted even though no 
changes are made in the control decks and no new bulk data is added. In addition, the RESTART 
cards (or dictionary) punched during the previous execution must be included in the Executive 
Control Deck. When changing rigid formats, the solution number (S0L) must be changed to the number 
of the new rigid format. 

A New Problem Tape (NPTP) is constructed only when checkpointing is requested (CHKPNT YES) in 
the Executive Control Deck. The NPTP should be assigned to a physical tape or other storage device 
that can be dismounted and saved at the conclusion of the execution. At the completion of an 
initial execution, the NPTP contains the input deck, with the bulk data in sorted form, and all of 
the files that were checkpointed during the execution. 

For restarts, the Old Problem Tape (0PTP) is defined as the Problem Tape that was written 
during the previous execution. The NPTP is defined as the Problem Tape written during the current 
execution, beginning with the restart. At the completion of an unmodified restart, the NPTP 
contains the input deck, with the bulk data in sorted form, all files from the 0PTP that are 
necessary to complete the solution, and all of the files checkpointed during the current execution. 
At the completion of a modified restart, the NPTP is similar, except that the input deck is 
modified according to the information submitted for the restart.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

1.1.4 Types of Restarts 

The type of a restart is determined automatically by the program by comparing the input data 
of the restart run with that of the checkpoint run. The user need not be concerned about the 
manner in which this is done, but may be interested in knowing the resulting type. 

The types of restarts presently recognized in NASTRAN are summarized in the following table.

In earlier versions of NASTRAN, an additional type of restart, called the pseudo modified 
restart, was recognized for cases involving changes only in output requests. This is no longer 
done since it is now handled as a special case of the modified restart. 

The manner in which a restart is handled by the program depends on its type and on its 
environment (rigid format or DMAP environment). This is discussed in the following sections. 

An important term that is frequently encountered in the following discussion is the reentry 
point for a t restart. This is defined as the last reentry point specified in the restart 
dictionary. It is an integer equal to the instruction number of the DMAP instruction in the 
checkpoint run at which an unmodified restart will resume execution. (See Volume I, Section 2.2.) 



1.1-7 (05/30/86) 



RIGID FORMATS 

1.1.4.1 Unmodified Restart 

An unmodified restart involves no effective changes to the data. The execution in this type 
of restart resumes at the reentry point. Unmodified restarts in both rigid format and DMAP 
environments are handled in an identical manner. 

It is useful to distinguish between two types of unmodified restarts. These are described 
below. 

- Unmodified restart in which the reentry point is not within a DMAP loop 

This is the simplest type of restart possible. In this case, the execution flags for all DMAP 
instructions prior to the reentry point are turned off and the execution flags for all DMAP 
instructions from the reentry point onwards are turned on. All input files or data blocks required 
for the restart already exist on the 0PTP and will be retrieved. 

- Unmodified restart in which the reentry point is within a DMAP loop. 

In this case, initially , the execution flags for all DMAP instructions prior to the reentry point 
are turned off and the execution flags for all DMAP instructions from the reentry point onwards are 
turned on. This is so indicated in the DMAP source listing. However, subsequently , the DMAP 
instructions prior to the reentry point and within the DMAP loop are recognized and their execution 
flags are turned on. The user is informed about this in the output. Note, however, that the 
execution does resume at the reentry point, even though DMAP instructions prior to this point are 
turned on. DMAP instructions within the DMAP loop and prior to the reentry point are executed only 
if additional passes in the loop need to be executed. If the restart is within the last pass of 
the DMAP loop, obviously DMAP instructions within the loop and prior to the reentry point are not 
executed even though their execution flags are on. 

All input files or data blocks required by the restart already exist on the 0PTP and will be 
retrieved. 

1.1.4.2 Modified Restart 

This type of restart involves one or more effective changes to the data in the Case Control 
Deck and/or in the Bulk Data Deck. 

The heart of the restart logic for modified restarts in the rigid format environment is the 
Module Execution Decision Table (MEDT) associated with each rigid format. The MEDT for each rigid 
format actually comprises three distinct tables. These are the Card Name Restart Table, the Rigid 
Format Change Restart Table and the File Name Restart Table associated with that rigid format. 
(See discussion in Section 1.1.7. See also Sections 1.10 and 7 of the Programmer's Manual.) 

1.1-8 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

In the case of modified restarts in the rigid format environment, all DMAP instructions from 
the reentry points onwards have their execution flags turned on. In addition, this type of restart 
generally requires that certain DMAP instructions prior to the reentry point also be turned on, 
depending on the specific data changes involved. The DMAP instructions that need to be so turned 
on are determined from the Card Name Restart Table. The DMAP source listing provided in the output 
indicates all the DMAP instructions whose execution flags are initially turned on by the above 
procedure. 

Once the DMAP instructions are initially turned on as described above, the program checks to 
see if all of the required input data blocks are either being generated by prior modules or are 
available on the 0PTP for retrieval. If so, no additional DMAP instructions need to be turned on. 
If, however, there are any input data blocks that are neither being generated by prior modules nor 
are available on the 0PTP, the program needs to turn on additional DMAP instructions in order to 
generate the required data blocks. The DMAP instructions that need to be so turned on are 
determined from the File Name Restart Table. 

After the additional DMAP instructions are turned on as described in the above paragraph, the 
process is repeated until it is ensured that all of the required input data blocks are either being 
generated by prior modules or can be retrieved from 0PTP. 

All the DMAP instructions that are turned on as per the above logic {by the use of the File 
Name Restart Table) are identified and listed in the restart output just after the DMAP source 
listing. 

It should be noted that the execution in a modified restart will start at the first module in 
the DMAP sequence whose execution flag is turned on . Generally, this is before the reentry point. 

In the case of modified restarts in the DMAP environment, the effect of changes in the Case 
Control Deck and/or in the Bulk Data Deck on particular modules cannot be determined since the DMAP 
itself is, by definitions not predefined. (An MEDT is meaningless for a DMAP.) Hence, it is 
assumed that the changes will affect the entire DMAP which, therefore, needs to be re-executed. 
This is accomplished in the program by re-setting the reentry point to zero and treating this case 
as an unmodified restart. This causes the entire DMAP to be re-executed. 

Those input files or data blocks that are needed for the restart and that are available on 
the 0PTP are retrieved, just as it is done in the case of modified restarts in the rigid format 
environment. 



1.1-9 (05/30/86) 



RIGID FORMATS . 

1.1.4.3 Modified Restart with Rigid Format Switch 

This type of restart involves a switch from one rigid format to another. It may or may not 
involve effective changes to the data in the Case Control Deck and/or in the Bulk Data Deck. 

The most important point to recognize in this type of restart is that the reentry point is 
quite meaningless since it was determined in relation to another rigid format. This is handled in 
the program by resetting the reentry point to an extremely high value which, for all practical 
purposes, can be considered to be infinite. As a result, all DMAP instructions in the restart are 
considered to be before the reentry point and no DMAP instructions are considered to exist after 
the reentry point. 

Once this important change is made, this type of restart is handled in the program in the 
same manner as a modified restart, with one important modification: the DMAP instructions that are 
initially turned on are determined not only from the Card Name Restart Table, but also from the 
Rigid Format Change Restart Table. 

1.1.5 Use of DMAP ALTERs in Restarts 

Because different types of restarts are handled differently by the program, the user should 
be careful in the use of DMAP ALTERs in restarts. 

In the case of an unmodified restart in which the reentry point is not within a DMAP loop, 
the only DMAP instructions that are flagged for execution are those that are beyond (and include) 
the reentry point. Hence, a DMAP ALTER will be flagged for execution only if it is beyond the 
reentry point and will be ignored if it is before the reentry point.* 

In the case of an unmodified restart in which the reentry point is within a DMAP loop, the 
only DMAP instructions flagged for execution are those that are beyond (and include) the reentry 
point and those that are before the reentry point but within the DMAP loop. Hence, a DMAP ALTER 
will be flagged for execution only if it is beyond the reentry point or before it but within the 
DMAP loop. Otherwise, it will be ignored.* 



* The user can ensure that a DMAP ALTER in an unmodified restart is flagged for execution by 
suitably deleting the latter part of the restart dictionary so that the reentry point is before 
the DMAP ALTER. This, of course, will cause more modules to be executed in the restart. 



1.1-10 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

In the case of a modified restart and a modified restart with rigid format switch, a DMAP 
ALTER will be flagged for execution regardless of its position in the DMAP with respect to ,the 
reentry point. 

1.1.6 Rigid Format Output 

Although most of the rigid format output is optional, some of the printer output is 
automatic. The printer output is designed for 132 characters per line, with the lines per page 
controlled by the NLINES keyword on the NASTRAN card (see Volume I, Section 2.1) and the LINE card 
in the Case Control Deck (see Volume I, Section 2.3). The NLINES and LINE default is set to fit on 
11-inch paper. Optional titles are printed at the top of each page from information in the Case 
Control Deck. These titles may be defined at the subcase level. The pages are automatically dated 
and numbered. 

The output from the data recovery and plot modules is all optional, and its selection is 
controlled by cards in the Case Control Deck. The details of making selections in the Case Control 
Deck are described in Volume I, Section 2.3 for printer and punch output, and in Volume I, Section 
4 for plotter output. Since the outputs from the data recovery and plot modules vary considerably 
with the rigid format, a list of available output is included in the section on the Case Control 
Deck for each rigid format. Information on the force and stress output available for each element 
type is given in Volume I, Section 1.3. 

The first part of the output for a NASTRAN run is prepared during the execution of the 
Preface, prior to the beginning of the DMAP sequence of the rigid format. The following output is 
either automatically or optionally provided during the execution of the Preface: 

1. NASTRAN title page - Two full pages automatic, unless changed with the TITLE0PT keyword 
on the NASTRAN card (see Volume I, Section 2.1) before the Executive Control Deck. 

2. Executive Control Deck echo - Automatic. 

3. Case Control Deck echo - Automatic. 

4. Unsorted Bulk Data Deck echo - Optional, selected in Case Control Deck with the ECH0 
Card. (Automatic in restart runs and in runs employing the User's Master File, unless 
suppressed in the Case Control Deck with the ECH0 card.) 

5. Sorted Bulk Data Deck echo - Automatic, unless suppressed in the Case Control Deck with 
the ECH0 Card. 

6. DMAP listing - Selected with DIAG 14 (or the LIST option on an XDMAP card) in the 
Executive Control Deck. Provides the list of DMAP instructions, including those 
resulting from ALTERs, for the subset of the rigid format being executed. (Automatic in 
restart runs and in runs using the DMAP approach (APP DMAP) or the substructure 
capability (APP DISP, SUBS), unless suppressed by the N0LIST option on an XDMAP card in 
the Executive Control Deck.) 

1.1-11 (05/30/86) 



RIGID FORMATS 

7. Checkpoint Dictionary - Automatic, when operating in the checkpoint mode. A printed echo 
(unless suppressed with the DIA6 9 card in the Executive Control Deck) and punched output 
are prepared for additions to the checkpoint dictionary after the execution of each 
checkpoint. 

When making restarts, the following additional output is automatically prepared during the 

execution of the Preface: 

1. Asterisks {*) are placed beside the DMAP statement numbers of all instructions that are 
flagged for execution in the restart. (It should be emphasized that a DMAP instruction 
marked with the symbol * is only flagged for execution; whether it actually gets executed 
or not is decided by the logic in the DMAP.) 

2. Pluses (+) are placed beside the DMAP statement numbers of all instructions that are 
processed only at DMAP compilation time. (DMAP instructions BEGIN, C0MP0FF, C0MP0N, 
FILE, LABEL, PRECHK and XDMAP are the only instructions that belong to this category.) 

3. Message indicating the bit position activated by a rigid format change. 

4. Message indicating the type of restart (unmodified, modified or modified with rigid 
format switch) . 

5. Table indicating, among other things, the effective data changes (if any) and the 
associated "packed bit positions" that control the restart. The table distinguishes 
between effective changes made to the Case Control Deck and those made to the Bulk Data 
Deck. The reader is referred to the Programmer's Manual for the full interpretation of 
this table. 

6. List of files along with the DMAP instructions that were marked for execution (if any) by 
the File Name Restart Table. 

7. List of files from the Old Problem Tape, including purged files, used to initiate the 
restart. 

A number of fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the various rigid formats. 
These messages indicate the presence of fatal user errors that either cannot be determined by the 
functional modules or can be more effectively detected by the DMAP statements in the rigid format. 
The detection of such an error causes a transfer to a LABEL instruction near the end of the rigid 
format. The text of the message is output and the execution is terminated. These messages will 
always appear at the end of the NASTRAN output. The messages applicable to each rigid format are 
described under the description of that rigid format, 

NASTRAN diagnostic messages are usually identified by numbers. These messages may be either 
program diagnostics or user diagnostics, and they may contain information, warnings, or an 
indication of a fatal error. There are also a few unnumbered, self-explanatory messages, for 
example, the time that the execution of each functional module begins and ends. 

The Grid Point Singularity Table (GPST) is automatically output following the execution of 
the Grid Point Singularity Processor (GPSP) if singularities remain in the stiffness matrix at the 
grid point level. This table contains all possible combinations of single-point constraints, in 
the global coordinate system, that can be used to remove the singularities. Entries in this table 

1.1-12 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

should only be treated as warnings, because it cannot be determined at the grid point level whether 
or not the singularities are removed by other means, such as general elements or multipoint 
constraints. Further information on this matter is given in the Theoretical Manual. 

Several items of output are discussed in other sections. Output that is not associated with 
all of the rigid formats is discussed in the sections treating the individual rigid formats. Some 
output is under the control of PARAM cards. These items are discussed in Volume I, Section 2.4 
(PARAM card). The DIAG card is used to control the printing of some output. A list of the 
available output under D.IAG control is given in the description of the Executive Control Deck in 
Volume I, Section 2.2. 

Any of the matrices or tables that are prepared by the functional modules can be printed by 
using selected utility modules described in Volume I, Section 5.5. These utility modules can be 
scheduled at any point in a rigid format by using the ALTER feature. (See Section 1.1.5 for the 
manner in which ALTERs are handled in restarts.) In general, they should be scheduled immediately 
after the functional module that generates the table or matrix to be printed. Note that functional 
modules cannot be separated from a SAVE instruction. However, the user is cautioned to check the 
calling sequence for the utility module, in order to be certain that all required inputs have been 
generated prior to this point. 

1.1.7 Rigid Format Data Base 

As indicated earlier, the Rigid Format Data Base contains the DMAP sequences and other 
information for all of the rigid formats in NASTRAN. Its design allows for convenient maintenance 
of the existing rigid formats as well as the addition of new rigid formats. Editing of the data 
base may be done by using standard text editors provided on the host computer systems. 

1.1.7.1 Design of the Data Base 

The Rigid Format Data Base is a collection of all rigid formats available to the user in 
NASTRAN. Each Rigid Format is maintained as a separate card-image entry within the data base. The 
entry for each rigid format consists of three parts. The first part is the DMAP part. It contains 
the DMAP sequence for the rigid format, the DMAP sequence subset flags, the restart flags (card 
name, file name and rigid format switch restart flags) and the substructure DMAP ALTER control 
flags. The second part contains the card name table and the third part contains the file name 
table. The restart flags in the first part and the name tables comprising the second and third

RIGID FORMATS 

parts are not processed by NASTRAN in non-restart runs. Similarly, the substructure control flags 

in the first part are not processed in non-substructure runs. 

The format of the data base is free field. Each of the three parts in a rigid format entry 

is separated from the other parts by a "$*" card. The following fictitious example illustrates a 

rigid format entry in the data base.

The very first card of an entry identifies the release of NASTRAN with which the rigid format 
is associated. In this example, the rigid format is associated with the April 1986 release. 

The "$*CARD" card separates the card name table from the DMAP part of the entry and the 
"$*FILE" card separates the file name table from the card name table. A "$*" card terminates the 
file name table and the rigid format entry. 

Comment cards are identified in the data base by the "$$$$" identification in the first four 
columns of the field and control cards are identified by the "****" identification in the first 
four columns of the field. 

1.1-14 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

Comment cards may be placed anywhere in the card name or file name tables (the second and 
third parts of a rigid format entry). However, comment cards have a required usage and serve a 
specific purpose in the DMAP part of a rigid format entry. In this part, a comment card is used to 
distinguish and separate a DMAP entry (that is, a DMAP statement and its associated control cards) 
from another DMAP entry. Hence, there must be at least one comment card separating a DMAP entry 
from the next DMAP entry. In the data base supplied with NASTRAN, a comment card with a trailing 
string of "*" is used for this purpose to serve as a cosmetic delineation between successive DMAP 
entries. 

All DMAP statements must conform to the rules as specified in Volume I, Section 5.2. Any 
card in the DMAP part of a rigid format entry that does not begin with "$$$$" or "****" in the 
first four columns of the field is considered to be a DMAP statement or part of a DMAP statement. 

Comment and control cards in a rigid format entry can extend up to 80 columns. However, DMAP 
cards can only extend up to 72 columns. 

Control cards (that is, cards that begin with "****" in the first four columns of the field) 
are permitted only in the DMAP part of a rigid format entry. A control card must have any one of 
seven four-character names in columns five through eight. The permissible names are: SBST, RFMT, 
CARD, FILE, PHS1, PHS2 and PHS3. Control cards follow the corresponding DMAP statement in the 
entry and may be specified in any order. 

The "SBST M , "RFMT", "CARD" and "FILE" control cards contain sequences of numbers and/or 
ranges of numbers in ascending order represented by the use of a dash. A comma is required after 
each number in a sequence or after a range of numbers, if an additional number or range of numbers 
is to follow. There may be multiple cards for any one of these control cards for a specific DMAP 
statement. 

The "SBST" control card provides DMAP sequence subset controls. If a user requests a given 
subset on the S0L card of a NASTRAN run and that number is in the sequence of numbers given on the 
"SBST" card, then the associated DMAP statement is deleted. The range of subset numbers is from 1 
to 9 and each number is documented under the description of the S0L Executive Control card in 
Volume I, Section 2.2. 

The "RFMT" control card is processed in restart runs and is applicable to cases where a rigid 
format switch has occurred. Each rigid format has a unique number assigned to it. For APPROACH 
DISP, rigid formats 1 through 16 are assigned the numbers 187 through 202, respectively. For 
APPR0ACH HEAT, rigid formats 1, 3 and 9 are assigned the numbers 207, 208 and 209, respectively. 

1.1-15 (05/30/86) 



RIGID FORMATS 

For APPROACH AER0, rigid formats 9, 10 and 11 are assigned the numbers 216, 214 and 215, 
respectively. A DMAP statement is flagged for execution in a modified restart if the number * 
associated with the rigid format that was used in the checkpointed run is listed in the sequence of 
numbers given on the "RFMT" card provided with the DMAP statement. 

The "CARD" and "FILE" control cards provide restart information for changes that involve 
input data or files within the DMAP. For a given rigid format, every type of effective change in 
the Case Control and Bulk Data Decks and each output file (or data block) in the DMAP is assigned a 
number as defined in the card name and file name tables in the second and third parts of a rigid 
format entry. In a modified restart, if the number associated with an input data change or an 
affected file appears in the sequence of numbers given on the "CARD" or "FILE" cards, then the 
corresponding DMAP statement is flagged for execution in the restart run. 

The information provided by all of the "CARD" control cards in a rigid format entry is 
collectively referred to as the Card Name Restart Table. Similarly, the information provided by 
all of the "FILE" and "RFMT" control cards in a rigid format entry is collectively referred to as 
the File Name Restart Table and the Rigid Format Change Restart Table, respectively. For a given 
rigid format, these three restart tables compose the Module Execution Decision Table (MEDT) of that 
rigid format. 

The "PHS1", "PHS2" and "PHS3" control cards are used to indicate where substructure DMAP 
ALTERs are to be generated. The number following the "PHS" refers to the substructure phase 
number. These cards must have one of the following flags: "In", "Dn", "DBn" or "DEn". The "n" in 
these flags is an integer that refers to the subroutine governing the substructure run (subroutine 
ASCM01, ASCM05, ASCM07 or ASCM08) and must have the value "1" for Phase 1 cards, either the value 
"5" or "8" for Phase 2 cards, and either the value "1" or "7" for Phase 3 cards. The "I" in the 
"In" flag indicates that a DMAP ALTER is to be inserted after this DMAP statement. The "D" in the 
"Dn" flag indicates that this DMAP statement is to be deleted and possibly replaced by a DMAP 
ALTER. The "DB" in the "DBn" flag and the "DE" in the "DEn" flag indicate the beginning and the 
end of a group of contiguous DMAP statements that are to be deleted and possibly replaced by a DMAP 
ALTER. Users are cautioned to be very careful in making any changes to these substructure control 
cards because of their impact on the DMAP ALTERs automatically generated in substructure analyses. 
(The automated substructure capability is currently implemented only in rigid formats 1, 2, 3, 8 
and 9, APPR0ACH DISP.) 



1.1-16 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

The card name and file name tables assign numbers to every type of effective change in the 
Case Control and Bulk Data Decks and to every output file (or data block) in the DMAP. Numbers 1 
through 93 are allocated to card names and numbers 94 through 186 are allocated to file (or data 
block) names. This information is used subsequently to determine the DMAP statements to be flagged 
for execution in modified restarts. The format of these tables is free field. Each entry in these 
tables must have an integer number in the first field and a list of names in the remaining fields 
of the entry. All names are to be alphanumeric and may contain up to a maximum of eight 
characters. No name should appear twice in these tables. Comment cards may be freely used in 
these tables to facilitate readability. 

1.1.7.2 Implementation of the Data Base 

The Rigid Format Data Base is implemented differently on the CDC, DEC VAX, IBM and UNIVAC 
versions. On the CDC and DEC VAX versions, each rigid format entry is stored as a separate file. 
The local names of these files during a NASTRAN execution are: DISP1 through DISP16 for APPR0ACH 
DISP; HEAT1, HEAT3 and HEAT9 for APPROACH HEAT; AER09, AER01O and AER011 for APPR0ACH AER0. These 
same files are stored as members of a partitioned data set (PDS) on the IBM version and as elements 
of the *NASTRAN file on the UNIVAC version. The member and element names are exactly the same as 
the local file names on the CDC and DEC VAX versions. On the IBM version, the PDS containing the 
Rigid Format Data Base must be referred to by a Data Definition card, "DD", with the DDname of 
RFDATA. On the UNIVAC version, the *NASTRAN file is the file containing the NASTRAN program 
absolutes. (See References 1 and 2 for the formats of file names for the CDC and DEC VAX versions, 
respectively. See Reference 3 for the formats of DDnames and member names for the IBM version. 
See Reference 4 for the format of UNIVAC file names.)

1.1.7.4 Development of User Rigid Formats 

In addition to using COSMIC-supplied rigid formats, users may develop their own rigid 
formats, with restart capabilities included. Rigid formats developed by users must conform to the 
rules explained earlier and must be similar in content and structure to the COSMIC-supplied rigid 
formats. Each user-developed rigid format must reside as a separate file on the CDC and DEC VAX 
versions, as a member of a PDS on the IBM version and as a file or file. element on the UNIVAC 

version. 

Before developing their own rigid formats, users are strongly advised to carefully study and 
examine the COSMIC-supplied rigid formats, particularly with regard to their use of control cards. 
The following important guidelines should help users in developing their own rigid formats. 



1.1-18 (05/30/86) 



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RIGID FORMATS 

1. The DMAP sequence of the user rigid format must be tested for its correctness and logic. 
This testing may be done either in a DMAP environment or in the environment of an s 
existing rigid format by use of ALTERs. 

2. The card name table (the second part of a rigid format entry) must be constructed by 
assigning numbers 1 through 93 for all types of Case Control and Bulk Data Deck changes 
that will affect the logic of the rigid format. Normally, those input data changes that 
have the same effect on the logic of the rigid format are assigned the same number. 

3. The file name table (the third part of a rigid format entry) must be constructed by 
assigning numbers 94 through 186 for all files (or data blocks) that are output by the 
functional modules in the rigid format. Normally, all files (or data blocks) output from 
a given functional module are assigned the same number. 

4. The DMAP part (the first part of a rigid format entry) must be constructed by following 
each statement in the DMAP sequence by the appropriate control cards and by ensuring that 
each DMAP entry (that is, a DMAP statement and its associated control cards) is separated 
from the next DMAP entry by at least one comment card. 

5. A given DMAP statement must be followed by a "SBST" control card if that DMAP statement 
belongs to one or more of the DMAP subsets. These subset numbers must be specified on 
the "SBST" card. The acceptable subset numbers and their meanings are documented under 
the description of the S0L Executive Control card in Volume I, Section 2.2. 

6. A "RFMT" control card must follow a DMAP statement if that DMAP instruction is to be 
flagged for execution on restart from a checkpoint of one of the COSMIC-supplied rigid 
formats. (It is not possible to have a restart in a COSMIC-supplied rigid format from a 
checkpoint of an user-developed rigid format.) This will be so if this DMAP instruction 
is not part of the DMAP sequence of the rigid format that was used in the checkpoint run. 
The "RFMT" control card must list the numbers of the appropriate COSMIC-supplied rigid 
formats (187 through 202 for rigid formats 1 through 16, respectively, for APPROACH DISP; 
207, 208 and 209 for rigid formats 1, 3 and 9, respectively, for APPR0ACH HEAT; and 216, 
214 and 215 for rigid formats 9, 10 and 11, respectively, for APPROACH AER0). 

7. A DMAP statement must be followed by one or more "CARD" control cards indicating the 
effective input data changes that require that DMAP instruction to be flagged for 
execution on restart. Any effective input data change will affect one or more files (or 
data blocks) or parameters in the DMAP sequence. Therefore, for a given data change, all 

1.1-19 (05/30/86) 



RIGID FORMATS 

DMAP instructions that use the affected files (or data blocks) or parameters as input are 
potential candidates to be flagged for execution on restart. However, the logic of these 
individual DMAP instructions must be checked further (see the Programmer's Manual) to see 
if they are really impacted by the given data change. This procedure must be applied in 
turn to those DMAP instructions that use the output of the affected DMAP instructions as 
input. This procedure must be repeated until the entire DMAP sequence has been 
considered. 

8. A DMAP statement must be followed by one or more "FILE" control cards indicating the DMAP 
files (or data blocks) whose generation requires the execution flag for that DMAP 
statement to be turned on during restart. Normally, for a given DMAP file (or data 
block) that is required on restart but is not available from the checkpoint run, the DMAP 
instruction that generated it must be flagged for execution. However, in practice, 
additional DMAP instructions like PURGE and EQUIV that manipulate the given file (or data 
block) must also be flagged. for execution. 

9. The restart flags for a C0ND DMAP instruction (and its companion LABEL DMAP instruction) 
must include the restart flags for those DMAP instructions whose execution it controls. 

10. "PHS1", "PHS2" and "PHS3" control cards must not be used as the substructure capability 
is not applicable to user rigid formats. 

1.1.7.5 Usage of User-Developed Rigid Formats 

An user-developed rigid format is referenced through the use of the S0L card in the Executive 
Control Deck. However, instead of specifying the solution number or the name of the 
COSMIC-supplied rigid format on this card, the name of the user-developed rigid format is 
specified. This name is a file name on the CDC and DEC VAX versions, a member name of a PDS on the 
IBM version and a file or file. element name on the UNIVAC version. The member name given on the 
IBM version must be in the file referenced on the RFDATA DD statement. The manner in which an 
user-developed rigid format is accessed and used is similar to that of a COSMIC-supplied rigid 
format, as explained in the examples given Section 1.1.7.3. Thus, for instance, an user-developed 
rigid format can be accessed and used on the CDC version in the following manner.

STATIC ANALYSIS 

2.1.2 Description of Important DMAP Operations for Static Analysis 

Note- The DMAP sequence for static analysis involves the use of parameters INTERACT and 
SYST1 (see Section 2.1.5). These parameters are of relevance only when the primary purpose 
of the user is to make interactive restart runs. (The two parameters are then specified via 
the PARAM card in the Bulk Data Deck.) However, these two parameters are not required for 
normal non-interactive batch runs. Consequently, the rigid format DMAP listing shown in 
Section 2.1.1 was generated by not specifying these parameters (via the PARAM bulk data 
card). As a result, the C0MP0FF and C0MP0N instructions using these parameters assume a 
value of for these parameters (see Volume I, Section 5.7). 

6. C0MP0FF causes the DMAP compiler to compile the next instruction (DMAP No. 7) as the 
parameter INTERACT is (see Note above). 

8 C0MP0N causes the DMAP compiler to skip the compilation of the next instruction (DMAP No. 9, 
not shown) as the parameter INTERACT is (see Note above). 

10 C0MP0FF causes the DMAP compiler to compile all of the following instructions through LABEL 
LBLINT02 (DMAP Nos. 11 through 169) as the parameter SYS21 is (see Note above).

loads. 

2. A static loading condition must be defined for (not necessarily within) each subcase 
with a L0AD, TEMPERATURE(L0AD) , or DEF0RM selection unless all loading is specified with 
grid point displacements on SPC cards. 

3. An SPC set must be selected for (not necessarily within) each subcase, unless the model 
is a properly supported free body, or all constraints are specified on GRID cards, 
Scalar Connection cards, or with General Elements. 

4. Loading conditions associated with the same sets of constraints should be in contiguous 
subcases in order to avoid unnecessary looping. 

5. REPCASE may be used to repeat subcases in order to allow multiple sets of the same 
output item.

data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. GRDEQ - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter selects the grid point 
about which equilibrium will be checked for the Case Control output request, MPCF0RCE. 
If the integer value is zero, the basic origin is used. The default value is -1. 

5. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. 

6. INTERACT - optional. This parameter, like the SYS21 parameter, is of relevance only 
when the primary purpose of the user is to make interactive restart runs. In such a 
case, the integer value of this parameter must be set to -1 (via a PARAM bulk data card) 
in both the batch checkpoint run (that precedes the interactive restart run) as well as 
in the interactive restart run. If not so specified via a PARAM bulk data card, the 
C0MP0FF and C0MP0N instructions in the DMAP sequence that use this parameter assume a 
value of for this parameter (see Volume I, Section 5.7). 

7. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following each execution of the SSG3 module. 

8. NINTPTS - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter specifies the number of 
closest independent points to be used in the interpolation for computing stresses or 
strains/curvatures at grid points (only for TRIA1, TRIA2, QUAD1 and QUAD2 elements). A 
negative integer value or specifies that all independent points are to be used in the 
interpolation. The default value is 0. 

9. 0PT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes both equilibrium and 
multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the Case Control output request, 
MPCF0RCE. A negative integer value of this parameter causes only the equilibrium force 
balance to be calculated for the output request. The default value is which causes 
only the multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the output request. 

2.1-17 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

10. STRAIN - optional. This parameter controls the transformation of element 
strains/curvatures to the material coordinate system (only for TRIA1, TRIA2, QUAD1 and t 
QUAD2 elements). If it is a positive integer, the strains/curvatures for these elements 
are transformed to the material coordinate system. If it is zero, strains/curvatures at 
the connected grid points are also computed in addition to the element 
strains/curvatures in the material coordinate system. A negative integer value results 
in no transformation of the strains/curvatures. The default value is -1. 

11. STRESS - optional. This parameter controls the transformation of element stresses to 
the material coordinate system (only for TRIA1, TRIA2, QUAD1 and QUAD2 elements). If it 
is a positive integer, the stresses for these elements are transformed to the material 
coordinate system. If it is zero, stresses at the connected grid points are also 
computed in addition to the element stresses in the material coordinate system. A 
negative integer value results in no transformation of the stresses. The default value 
is -1. 

12. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

13. SYS21 - optional. This parameter, like the INTERACT parameter, is of relevance only 
when the primary purpose of the user is to make interactive restart runs. In such a 
case, the integer value of this parameter must be set to -1 (via a PARAM bulk data card) 
in the interactive restart run (that follows a batch checkpoint run). If not so 
specified via a PARAM bulk data card, the C0MP0FF and C0MP0N instructions in the DMAP 
sequence that use this parameter assume a value of for this parameter (see Volume I, 
Section 5.7). 

14. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

15. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the mass matrix are multiplied by the real value of 
this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module.

2.1.6 Automatic ALTERs for Automated Multi-stage Substructuring 

The following lines of the Static Analysis, Rigid Format 1, are ALTERed for automated 
substructure analyses. 

Phase 1: 5, 56, 78-85, 87-153 

Phase 2: 5, 11-11, 14-24, 28-29, 35-35, 49-52, 59-64, 103-153 
Phase 3: 78-85, 88-95, 96 
If APP DISP, SUBS is used, the user may also specify ALTERs. However, these must not 
interfere with the automatically generated DMAP statement ALTERs listed above. See Volume I, 
Section 5.9 for a description and listing of the ALTERs which are automatically generated for 
substructuring. 

2.1.7 Rigid Format Error Messages from Static Analysis 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Static Analysis rigid 
format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters and is followed by 
additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial action. 

STATIC ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 1 - ATTEMPT T0 EXECUTE M0RE THAN 360 L00PS. 

An attempt has been made to use more than 360 different sets of boundary conditions or more than 
360 passes in the optimization loop have been attempted. This number may be increased by ALTERing 
the REPT instruction following SDR1 in the former case and the REPT instruction following the last 
PRTMSG instruction in the latter case. 

STATIC ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 2 - MASS MATRIX REQUIRED F0R WEIGHT AND BALANCE CALCULATI0NS. 

The mass matrix is null because either no elements were defined with Connection cards, 
nonstructural mass was not defined on a Property card, or the density was not defined on a Material 
card. 

STATIC ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 3 - N0 INDEPENDENT DEGREES 0F FREED0M HAVE BEEN DEFINED. 

Either no degrees of freedom have been defined on GRID, SP0INT or Scalar Connection cards, or all 
defined degrees of freedom have been constrained by SPC, MPC, SUP0RT, 0MIT or GRDSET cards, or 
grounded on Scalar Connection cards. 

STATIC ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 4 - N0 ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN DEFINED. 

No elements have been defined with either Connection cards or GENEL cards.

with a L0AD selection. 

3. An SPC set may be selected only if used to remove grid point singularities or some, but 
not all, of the free body motions. At least one free body support must be provided with 
a SUP0RT card in the Bulk Data Deck. 

4. Loading conditions associated with the same sets of constraints should be in contiguous 
subcases in order to avoid unnecessary looping. 

5. REPCASE may be used to repeat subcases in order to allow multiple sets for the same 
output item. 

2.2.5 Parameters for Static Analysis with Inertia Relief

data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. GRDEQ - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter selects the grid point 
about which equilibrium will be checked for the Case Control output request, MPCF0RCE. 
If the integer value is zero, the basic origin is used. The default value is -1. 

5. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. 

6. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following the execution of the SSG3 module. 

7. 0PT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes both equilibrium and 
multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the Case Control output request, 
MPCF0RCE. A negative integer value of this parameter causes only the equilibrium force 
balance to be calculated for the output request. The default value is which causes 
only the multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the output request. 

8. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

9. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See

2.3.4 Case Control Deck for Normal Modes Analysis 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Normal Modes 
Analysis: 

1. METH0D must be used to select an EIGR card that exists in the Bulk Data Deck. 

2.3-13 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

2. On restart, the current EIGR card controls the eigenvalue extraction, regardless of what 
calculations were made in the previous execution. Consequently, when making restarts 
with either the Determinant method, the Inverse Power method or the Tridiagonal 
Reduction (PEER) method, METH0D should be changed to select an EIGR card that avoids the 
extraction of previously found eigenvalues. This is particularly important following 
unscheduled exits due to insufficient time to find all eigenvalues in the range of 
interest. 

3. An SPC set must be selected unless the model is a free body or all constraints are 
specified on GRID cards, Scalar Connection cards or with General Elements. 

4. Multiple subcases are used only to control output requests. A single subcase is 
sufficient if the same output is desired for all modes. If multiple subcases are 
present, the output requests will be honored in succession for increasing mode numbers. 
M0DES may be used to repeat subcases in order to make the same output request for 
several consecutive modes. 

2.3.5 Parameters for Normal Modes Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Normal Modes Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTR1A2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. GRDEQ - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter selects the grid point 
about which equilibrium will be checked for the Case Control output request, MPCF0RCE. 
If the integer value is zero, the basic origin is used. The default value is -1. 

5. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 



2.3-14 (05/30/86) 



NORMAL MODES ANALYSIS 

6. 0PT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes both equilibrium and 
multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the Case Control output request, 
MPCF0RCE. A negative integer value of this parameter causes only the equilibrium force 
balance to be calculated for the output request. The default value is which causes 
only the multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the output request. 

7. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

9. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems.

2.3.7 The APPEND Feature 

In real eigenvalue analysis, it is frequently necessary to add new eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors to those already computed in a previous run. The APPEND feature (see Section 9.2.2 of 
the Theoretical Manual for details) makes it possible to do this without re-executing the entire 
problem. It is available when using the Inverse Power, Determinant and iridiagonal Reduction 
(FEER) methods of eigenvalue extraction. 

In order to use the APPEND feature, the user should employ the following steps: 

1. Request a checkpoint of an eigenvalue problem by employing either the Inverse Power, 
Determinant or Tridiagonal Reduction (FEER) method. 

2. Check to ensure that at least one eigenvalue and one eigenvector are computed in this 
run and that the LAMA (eigenvalue) and PHIA (eigenvector) files are successfully 
checkpointed. 

3. Restart the problem by changing either the METH0D card in the Case Control Deck and/or 
the EIGR card in the Bulk Data Deck and ensuring that the following conditions are 
satisfied: 

a. The structural model and the constraint data for the restart must be the same as 
that used in the checkpoint run. 

b. The method of eigenvalue extraction employed in the restart need not be the same as 
that used in the checkpoint run, but the range of eigenvalues specified on the EIGR 
Bulk Data card should not include the eigenvalues already checkpointed in Step 1. 

c. If the user wishes to retrieve only a subset of the checkpointed eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors, a DMAP alter should be employed in the Executive Control Deck to reset 
the parameter NEIGV to the desired value by means of a PARAM statement just before 
the READ module in the DMAP sequence. (See Section 9.2.2 of the Theoretical Manual 
for details.) 



2.3-17 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

4. Note that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors output by the restart include those retrieved 
from the checkpointed run of Step 1. Also, the resulting eigenvectors are normalized 
according to the method of normalization specified in the restart. 

2.3.8 Automatic ALTERs for Automated Multi-stage Substructuring 

The following lines of the Normal Modes Analysis, Rigid Format 3, are ALTERed in automated 
substructure analyses. 

Phase 1: 4, 42, 65-70, 71-91 

Phase 2: 4, 5-5, 8-18, 21-21, 30-30, 36-39, 44-49, 79-93 

Phase 3: 65-70, 71-77, 78 

If APP DISP, SUBS is used, the user may also specify ALTERs. However, these must not 
interfere with the automatically generated DMAP statement ALTERs listed above. See Volume I, 
Section 5.9 for a description and listing of the ALTERs which are automatically generated for 
substructuring. 

2.3.9 Rigid Format Error Messages from Normal Modes Analysis 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Normal Modes Analysis 
rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters and is followed by 
additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial action.

STATIC ANALYSIS WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS 

2.4.3 Output for Static Analysis with Differential Stiffness 

The value of the determinant of the sum of the elastic stiffness and the differential 
stiffness is automatically printed for each differential stiffness loading condition. 

Iterative differential stiffness computations are terminated for one of five reasons. 
Iteration termination reasons are automatically printed in an information message. These reasons 
have the following meanings: 

1. REASON means the iteration procedure was incomplete at the time of exit. This is 
caused by either an unexpected interruption of the iteration procedure (i.e., system 
abort) or termination is not scheduled (for the other four reasons) at the completion of 
the current iteration. 

2. REASON 1 means the iteration procedure converged to the EPSI0 value supplied by the user 
on a PARAM bulk data card. (The default value of EPSI0 is 1.0E-5.) 

3. REASON 2 means the iteration procedure is diverging from the EPSI0 value supplied by the 
user on a PARAM bulk data card. (The default value of EPSI0 is 1.0E-5.) 

4. REASON 3 means insufficient time remaining to achieve convergence to the EPSI0 value 
supplied by the user on a PARAM bulk data card. (The default value of EPSI0 is 1.0E-5.) 

5. REASON 4 means the number of iterations supplied by the user on a PARAM bulk data card 
has been met. (The default number of iterations is 10.) 

Parameter values at the time of exit are automatically output as follows: 

1. Parameter D0NE: -1 is normal; + N is the estimate of the number of iterations required 
to achieve convergence. 

2. Parameter SHIFT: +1 indicates a return to the top of the inner loop was scheduled; -1 
indicates a return to top of the outer loop was scheduled following the current 
iteration. 

3. Parameter DSEPSI: the value of the ratio of energy error to total energy at the time of 
exit. 

The following output may be requested: 

1. Nonzero Components of the applied static load for the linear solution at selected grid 
points. 

2. Displacements and nonzero components of the single-point forces of constraint, with and 
without differential stiffness, at selected grid points. 

3. Forces and stresses in selected elements, with and without differential stiffness. 

2.4-17 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

4. Scanned output of forces and elements in selected elements. 

The following plotter output may be requested: 

1. Undeformed and deformed plots of the structural model. 

2. Contour plots of stresses and displacements. 

2.4.4 Case Control Deck for Static Analysis with Differential Stiffness 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Static Analysis with 
Differential Stiffness: 

1. The Case Control Deck must contain two subcases. 

2. A static loading condition must be defined above the subcase level with a L0AD, 
TEMPERATURE (L0AD), or DEF0RM selection, unless all loading is specified by grid point 
displacements on SPC cards. 

3. An SPC set must be selected above the subcase level unless all constraints are specified 
on GRID cards. 

4. Output requests that apply only to the linear solution must appear in the first subcase. 

5. Output requests that apply only to the solution with differential stiffness must be 
placed in the second subcase. 

6. Output requests that apply to both solutions, with and without differential stiffness, 
may be placed above the subcase level. 

2.4.5 Parameters for Static Analysis with Differential Stiffness 

The following parameters are used in Static Analysis with Differential Stiffness: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. BET AD - optional. The integer value of this parameter is the number of iterations 
allowed for computing the load correction in the inner (load) loop before shifting to 
the outer (stiffness) loop, which adjusts the differential stiffness. The default value 
is 4 iterations. 

4. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 



2.4-18 (05/30/86) 



STATIC ANALYSIS WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS 

CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

5. EPSI0 - optional. The real value of this parameter is used to test the convergence of 

-5 
the iterated differential stiffness. The default value is 10 . 

6. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. 

7. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following the execution of the SSG3 module. 

8. NT - optional. The integer value of this parameter limits the cumulative number of 
iterations in both loops. The default value is 10 iterations. 

9. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

10. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 

three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 
11. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the mass matrix are multiplied by the real value of 
this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. 

2.4.6 Rigid hormat Error Messages from Static Analysis with Differential Stiffness 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Static Analysis with 
Differential Stiffness rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital 
letters and is followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial 
action.

2.5.3 Output for Buckling Analysis 

The summary of the eigenvalues associated with the buckling modes and the summary of the 
eigenvalue analysis performed, as described in the Normal Mode Analysis rigid format (see Section 
2.3.3), are automatically printed. 

The following output may be requested: 

1. Displacements and nonzero components of the static loads and single-point forces of 
constraint at selected grid points for the static analysis. 

2. Forces and stresses in selected elements for the static loading condition. 

3. Mode shapes and nonzero components of the single-point forces of constraint at selected 
grid points for selected modes. 

4. Scanned output of forces and elements in selected elements. 
The following plotter output may be requested: 

1. Undeformed plot of the structural model and mode shapes for selected buckling modes. 

2. Contour plots of stresses and displacements for selected buckling modes. 

2.5.4 Case Control Deck for Buckling Analysis 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Buckling Analysis: 

1. The Case Control Deck must contain at least two subcases. Subcases beyond the second 
are used only for output selection. 

2. METH0D must appear in the second subcase to select an EIGB card from the Bulk Data Deck. 

3. A static loading condition must be defined in the first subcase with a L0AD, TEMPERATURE 
(L0AD), or DEF0RM selection, unless all loading is specified by grid point displacements 
on SPC cards. 

4. An SPC set must be selected above the subcase level, unless all constraints are 
specified on GRID cards. 

5. Output requests that apply only to the solution under static load must be placed in the 
first subcase. 

6. Output requests that apply to the buckling solution only must be placed in the second 
and succeeding subcases. If only two subcases exist, the output requests in the second 
subcase will be honored for all buckling modes. 

7. Output requests that apply to both the static solution and the buckling modes may be 
placed above the subcase level.

DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMAlS 

2.5.5 Parameters for Buckling Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Buckling Analysis: t 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. 

5. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following the execution of the SSG3 module. 

6. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

7. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the mass matrix are multiplied by the real value of 
this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. 

2.5.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for FEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIAG 16 in the Executive Control Deck is 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6).

2.6.3 Output for Piecewise Linear Static Analysis 

The following output may be requested for Piecewise Linear Static Analysis: * 

1. Accumulated sums of displacements and nonzero components of the static loads and 
single-point forces of constraint at selected grid points for each load increment. 

2. Stresses in selected elements. If an element is composed of a nonlinear material, the 
accumulated stress will be output for each load increment. Stresses in linear elements 
are only calculated for the total load. 

3. Scanned output of forces and elements in selected elements. 
I he following plotter output may be requested: 

1. Undeformed plot of the structural model and deformed plots for each load increment. 

2. Contour plots of stresses and displacements for each load increment. 

2.6.4 Case Control Deck for Piecewise Linear Sta tic Analysis 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Piecewise Linear 
Static Analysis: 

1. The Case Control Deck must contain one and only one subcase. 

2. A static loading condition must be defined with a L0AD selection. 

3. An SPC set must be selected unless all constraints are specified on GRID cards. 

4. PLC0EFFICIENT must appear either to select a PLFACT set from the Bulk Data Deck or to 
explicitly select the default value of unity. 

2.6.5 Parameters for Piecewise Linear Static Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Piecewise Linear Static Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2 « AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 



2.6-13 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

4. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. 

5. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following the execution of the SSG3 module. 

6. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

7. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the mass matrix are multiplied by the real value of 
this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. 

2.6.6 Rigid Format Error Messages from Piecewise Linear Static Analysis 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Piecewise Linear 
Static Analysis rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters 
and is followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial action. 

PIECEWISE LINEAR STATIC ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 1 - N0 N0NLINEAR ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN DEFINED. 

A piecewise linear problem has not been formulated because none of the elements has a stress 
dependent modulus of elasticity defined on a Material card.

All eigenvalues found in the region specified. 

Three times the number of roots estimated in the region have been extracted. 
All eigenvalues that exist in the problem have been found. 
The number of roots desired have been found. 

One or more eigenvalues have been found outside the region specified. 
Insufficient time to find another root. 
Unable to converge, 
lowing summary of the eigenvalue analysis performed, using the complex Tridiagonal 
Reduction (FEER) method, is automatically printed: 

1. Number of eigenvalues extracted. 

2. Number of starting points used. 

This corresponds to the total number of random starting and restart vectors used by the 
complex FEER process for all neighborhoods. 

3. Number of starting point moves. 

Not used in FEER (set equal to zero). 

4. Number of triangular decompositions. 

Always equal to the number of points of interest (neighborhoods) in the complex plane 
processed by FEER, since ordinarily only one triangular decomposition is required by 
FEER for each point of interest, unless the dynamic matrix is singular at a given point 
of interest, in which case an additional decomposition is required (obtained by moving 
the point of interest slightly). 

5. Total number of vector iterations. 

The total number of reorthogonalizations of all the trial vectors employed. 

6. Reason for termination. 

(0) All, or more solutions than the number requested by the user, have been determined 
(normal termination).

(1) All neighborhoods have been processed, but FEER has not obtained the desired number 
of roots in each neighborhood, possibly because they have already been found in 
other neighborhoods. 

(2) Abnormal termination - either no roots found or none passes the FEER error test. 
The following printed output, sorted by complex eigenvalue root number (S0RT1), may be 

requested for any complex eigenvalue extracted, as either real and imaginary parts or magnitude and 
phase angle (0° - 360° lead): 

1. The eigenvector for a list of PHYSICAL points {grid points and extra scalar points 
introduced for dynamic analysis) or S0LUTI0N points (points used in the formulation of 
the dynamic equation). 

2. Nonzero components of the single-point forces of constraint for a list of PHYSICAL 
points. 

3. Stresses and forces in selected elements. 

In addition, an undeformed plot of the structural model may be requested. 

2.7.4 Case Control Deck for Direct Complex Eigenvalue Analysis 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Direct Complex 
Eigenvalue Analysis: 

1. At least one subcase must be defined for each unique set of direct input matrices (K2PP, 
M2PP, B2PP). 

2. Multiple subcases for each set of direct input matrices are used only to control output 
requests. A single subcase for each set of direct input matrices is sufficient if the 
same output is desired for all modes. If consecutive multiple subcases are present for 
a single set of direct input matrices, the output requests will be honored in succession 
for increasing mode numbers. M0DES may be used to repeat subcases in order to make the 
same output request for several consecutive modes. 

3. CMETH0D must be used to select an EIGC card from the Bulk Data Deck for each set of 
direct input matrices. 

4. On restart following an unscheduled exit due to insufficient time, the subcase structure 
must be changed to reflect the sets of direct input matrices that were completed, and 
either CMETH0D must be changed to select an EIGC card that reflects any complex 
eigenvalues found in the previous execution or EIGP cards must be used to insert poles 

2.7-15 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

for previously found eigenvalues. Otherwise, the previously found eigenvalues will be 

extracted again. 
5. Constraints must be defined above the subcase level. 
2.7.5 Parameters for Direct Complex Eigenvalue Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Direct Complex Eigenvalue Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the 6P4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CP1RIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. G^ - optional. The real value of this parameter is used as a uniform structural damping 
coefficient in the direct formulation of dynamics problems {see Section 9.3.3 of the 
Theoretical Manual). Not recommended for use in hydroelastic problems. 

5. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

6. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

7 - V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 

three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems.

2.8.3 Output for Direct Frequency and Random Response 

The following printed output, sorted by frequency (S0RT1) or by point number or element t 
number (S0RT2), is available, either as real and imaginary parts or magnitude and phase angle (0° - 
360° lead), for the list of frequencies specified by 0FREQUENCY: 

1. Displacements, velocities and accelerations for a list of PHYSICAL points (grid points 
and extra scalar points introduced for dynamic analysis) or S0LUTI0N points (points used 
in the formulation of the dynamic equation). 

2. Nonzero components of the applied load vector and single-point forces of constraint for 
a list of PHYSICAL points. 

3. Stresses and forces in selected elements (ALL available only for S0RT1).

printed summary is prepared for each X-Y plot which includes the maximum and minimum values of the 
plotted function. 

2.8.4 Case Control Deck for Direct Frequency and Random Response 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Direct Frequency and 
Random Response: 

2.8-16 (05/30/86) 



DIRECT FREQUENCY AND RANDOM RESPONSE 

1. At least one subcase must be defined for each unique set of direct input matrices (K2PP, 
M2PP, B2PP) or frequencies. , 

2. Consecutive subcases for each set of direct input matrices or frequencies are used to 
define the loading conditions - one subcase for each dynamic loading condition. 

3. Constraints must be defined above the subcase level. 

4. DL0AD must be used to define a frequency-dependent loading condition for each subcase. 

5. FREQUENCY must be used to select one, and only one, FREQ, FREQ1, or FREQ2 card from the 
Bulk Data Deck for each unique set of direct input matrices. 

6. On restart following an unscheduled exit due to insufficient time, the subcase structure 
must be changed to reflect the sets of direct input matrices that were completed, and 
FREQUENCY must be changed to select a FREQ, FREQ1, or FREQ2 card that reflects any 
frequencies for which the response has already been determined. Otherwise, the previous 
calculations will be repeated. 

7. ^FREQUENCY may be used above the subcase level or within each subcase to select a subset 
of the solution frequencies for output requests. The default is to use all solution 
frequencies. 

8. If Random Response calculations are desired, RAND0M must be used to select RANDPS and 
RANDTi cards from the Bulk Data Deck. Only one ^FREQUENCY and FREQUENCY card can be 
used for each set of direct input matrices. 

2.8.5 Parameters for Direct Frequency and Random Response 

The following parameters are used in Direct Frequency and Random Response: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. G - optional. The real value of this parameter is used as a uniform structural damping 
coefficient in the direct formulation of dynamics problems (see Section 9.3.3 of the 
Theoretical Manual). Not recommended for use in hydroelastic problems. 

2.8-17 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

5. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. " 

6. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

7. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems. 

2.8.6 Automatic ALTERs for Automated Multi-stage Substructuring 

The following lines of the Direct Frequency and Random Response, Rigid Format 8, are ALTERed 
in automated substructure analyses. 



Phase 1 
Phase 2 
Phase 3 



4, 56, 88-120, 121-162 

4, 5-5, 10-20, 23-24, 43-53, 111-112, 118-118, 135-158 

87, 90-136, 138, 160-162 
If APP DISP, SUBS is used, the user may also specify ALTERs. However, these must not 
interfere with the automatically generated DMAP statement ALTERs listed above. See Volume I, 
Section 5.9 for a description and listing of the ALTERs which are automatically generated for 
substructuring. 

2.8.7 Rigid Format Error Messages from Direct Frequency and Random Response 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Direct Frequency and 
Random Reponse rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters and 
is followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial action. 

DIRECT FREQUENCY AND RAND0M RESPONSE ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 1 - FREQUENCY RESPONSE LIST REQUIRED F0R 
FREQUENCY RESP0NSE CALCULATIONS. 

Frequencies to be used in the solution of frequency response problems must be supplied on a FREQ, 

2.8-18 (05/30/86) 



DIRECT FREQUENCY AND RANDOM RESPONSE 

FREQ1, or FREQ2 card in the Bulk Data Deck and FREQ in the Case Control Deck must select a 
frequency response set. 

DIRECT FREQUENCY AND RAND0M RESP0NSE ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 2 - DYNAMIC L0ADS TABLE REQUIRED F0R 
FREQUENCY RESP0NSE CALCULATI0NS. 

Dynamic loads to be used in the solution of frequency response problems must be specified on an 
RL0AD1 or RL0AD2 card in the Bulk Data Deck and DL0AD in the Case Control Deck must select a 
dynamic load set. 

DIRECT FREQUENCY AND RAND0M RESP0NSE ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 3 - ATTEMPT T0 EXECUTE M0RE THAN 100 L00PS. 

An attempt has been made to use more than 100 sets of direct input matrices. This number may be 
increased by ALTERing the REPT instruction following the last 0FP instruction. 

DIRECT FREQUENCY AND RAND0M RESP0NSE ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 4 - MASS MATRIX REQUIRED F0R WEIGHT AND 
BALANCE CALCULATI0NS. 

The mass matrix is null because either no elements were defined on Connection cards, nonstructural 
mass was not defined on a Property card, or the density was not defined on a Material card.

each subcase. 

3. All constraints must be defined above the subcase level. 

4. TSTEP must be used to select the time-step intervals to be used for integration and 
output in each subcase. 

2.9-15 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

5. If nonzero initial conditions are desired, IC must be used to select a TIC card in the 
Bulk Data Deck. 

6. On restart following an unscheduled exit due to insufficient time, the subcase structure 
should be changed to reflect any completed loading conditions. The TSTEP selections 
must be changed if it is desired to resume the integration at the point terminated. 

2.9.5 Parameters for Direct Transient Respo nse 

The following parameters are used in Direct Transient Response: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2* AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. G - optional. The real value of this parameter is used as a uniform structural damping 
coefficient in the direct formulation of dynamics problems (see Section 9.3.3 of the 
Theoretical Manual). Not recommended for use in hydroelastic problems. 

5 - GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

6, I START - optional. A positive value of this parameter causes the TRD module to use the 
second (or alternate) starting method (see Section 11.4 of the Theoretical Manual). The 
alternate starting method is recommended when initial accelerations are significant and 
when the mass matrix is non-singular. The default value is -1 and causes the first 
starting method to be used. 

7- SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 

two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 

three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 

2.9-16 (05/30/86) 



DIRECT TRANSIENT RESPONSE 

the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 
9. W3_and_W4 - optional. The real values (radians/unit time) of these parameters are used 
as pivotal frequencies for uniform structural damping and element structural damping, 
respectively (see Section 9.3.3 of the Theoretical Manual). Parameter W3 is required if 
uniform structural damping is desired. Parameter W4 is required if structural damping 
is desired for any of the structural elements. Parameter W3 should not be used for 
hydroelastic problems. 
10. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems. 

2.9.6 The CONTINUE Feature 

In transient analysis, it is frequently necessary to continue the integration of the coupled 
equations beyond the last (or from any earlier intermediate) output time for which the solution was 
obtained in a previous run. The CONTINUE feature (see Section 11.4.2 of the Theoretical Manual for 
details) makes it possible to do this without re-executing the entire problem. 

In order to use the CONTINUE feature, the user should employ the following steps: 

1. Request a checkpoint of a coupled transient analysis problem. 

2. Check to ensure that the solution for at least one output time is computed in this run 
and that the T0L (list of output times) and UDVT (displacement - velocity - 
acceleration) files are successfully checkpointed. 

3. Restart the problem by changing any one or more of several cards either in the Case 
Control Deck (DL0AD, N0NLINEAR, TSTEP cards) and/or in the Bulk Data Deck (TSTEP, DAREA, 
DL0AD, F0RCE, etc.) that define either the dynamic loading and/or the time step 
selection. Ensure that the following conditions are satisfied. 

a. The structural model and the constraint data for the restart must be the same as 
that used in the checkpoint run. 

b. The dynamic loading and/or the time step selection in the restart need not be the 
same as that used in the checkpoint run. 

c. If the user wishes to continue the integration from an intermediate (rather than 
from the last) output time of the checkpoint run, a DMAP alter should be employed in 
the Executive Control Deck to reset the parameter NC0L to the appropriate value by 

2.9-17 (05/30/86) 

as 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

means of a PARAM statement just before the TRLG module in the DMAP sequence. (See 
Section 11.4.2 of the Theoretical Manual for details). 
4. Note that the output of the restart does ncrt include the solutions of the checkpoint 
run, but only those solutions that are computed by the restart. Also, any initial 
conditions specified in the data for the restart are ignored since the solution is 
continued by using the displacements, velocities and accelerations corresponding to the 
specified output time of the checkpoint run as initial conditions. 

2-._9.7 Automatic ALTERS for Automated Multi-stage Substructuring 

The following lines of the Direct Transient Response, Rigid Format 9, are ALTERed in 
automated substructue analyses. 

Phase 1: 4, 56, 88-124, 125-153 

Phase 2: 4, 5-5, 10-20, 23-24, 43-53, 109-110, 116-116, 135-149 

Phase 3: 87, 92-136, 138, 151-153 

If APP DISP, SUBS is used, the user may also specify ALTERs. However, these must not 
interfere with the automatically generated DMAP statement ALTERs listed above. See Volume I, 
Section 5.9 for a description and listing of the ALTERs which are automatically generated for 
substructuring. 

2.9.8 Rigid Format Error Messages from Direct Transient Response 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Direct Transient

2,10.3 Output for Modal Complex Eigenvalue Analysis 

The real Eigenvalue Summary Table and the real Eigenvalue Analysis Summary, as described 
under Normal Modes Analysis {see Section 2.3.3), are automatically printed. All real eigenvalues 
extracted are included even though not all are used in the modal formulation. 

The complex Eigenvalue Summary Table and the complex Eigenvalue Analysis Summary, as ' 
described under Direct Complex Eigenvalue Analysis (see Section 2.7.3), are automatically printed 
for each set of direct input matrices. 

Output that may be requested is the same as that described under Direct Complex Eigenvalue 
Analysis. Output for S0LUTI0N points will have the modal coordinates identified by the mode number 
determined in real eigenvalue analysis. 

The eigenvectors used in the modal formulation may be obtained for the S0LUTI0N points by 
using the ALTER feature to print the matrix of eigenvectors following the execution of READ. The 
eigenvectors for all points in the model may be obtained by running the problem initially on the 
Normal Modes Analysis Rigid Format or by making a modified restart using the Normal Modes Analysis 
rigid format. 

2.10.4 Case Control Deck for Modal Complex Eigenvalue Analysis 

The following items related to subcase definition and data selection must be considered in 
addition to the list presented with Direct Complex Eigenvalue Analysis: 

1. METH0D must appear above the subcase level to select an EIGR card that exists in the 
Bulk Data Deck. 

2. All of the eigenvectors used in the modal formulation must be determined in a single 
execution. 

3. An SPC set must be selected above the subcase level unless the model is a free body or 
all constraints are specified on GRID cards, Scalar Connection cards or with General 
Elements. 

4. SDAMPING must be used to select a TABDMP1 table if structural damping is desired. 

2.10.5 Parameters for Modal Complex Eigenvalue Analysis

the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2* AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQPPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4- GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

5. LFREQ and HFREQ - required, unless parameter LM0DES is used. The real values of these 
parameters give the cyclic frequency range (LFREQ is the lower limit and HFREQ is the 
upper limit) of the modes to be used in the modal formulation. To use this option, 
parameter LM0DES must be set to 0. 

6. LM0DES - required, unless parameters LFREQ and HFREQ are used. The integer value of 
this parameter is the number of lowest modes to be used in the modal formulation. 

7. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

8. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details, 

9. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems. 

2.10.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for FEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIAG 16 in the Executive Control Deck is 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6).

MODAL COMPLEX EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS 

2.10.7 The APPEND Feature 

The APPEND feature can be used for real eigenvalue extraction in Modal Complex Eigenvalue 
Analysis. See Section 2.3.7 for details. 

2.10.8 Rigid Format Error Messages from Modal Complex Eigenvalue Analysis 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Modal Complex 
Eigenvalue Analysis rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital 
letters and is followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial 
action. 

M0DAL C0MPLEX EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 1 - MASS MATRIX REQUIRED F0R M0DAL F0RMULATI0N. 

The mass matrix is null because either no structural elements were defined with Connection cards, 
nonstructural mass was not defined on a Property card, or the density was not defined on a Material 
card. 

M0DAL C0MPLEX EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 2 - EIGENVALUE EXTRACTI0N DATA REQUIRED F0R 
REAL EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS. 

Eigenvalue extraction data must be supplied on an EIGR card in the Bulk Data Deck and METH0D in the 
Case Control Deck must select an EIGR set. 

M0DAL C0MPLEX EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 3 - ATTEMPT T0 EXECUTE M0RE THAN 100 L00PS. 

An attempt has been made to use more than 100 different sets of direct input matrices. This number 
can be increased by ALTERing the REPT instruction following the last 0FP instruction. 

M0DAL C0MPLEX EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 4 - REAL EIGENVALUES REQUIRED F0R M0DAL 
F0RMULATI0N. 

No real eigenvalues were found in the frequency range specified by the user. 

M0DAL C0MPLEX EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 5 - N0 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN DEFINED. 
No structural elements have been defined with Connection cards.

2.11.3 Output for Modal Frequency and Random Response 

The Eigenvalue Summary Table and the Eigenvalue Analysis Summary, as described under 'Normal 
Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.3), are automatically printed. All real eigenvalues extracted are 
included even though not all are used in the modal formulation. 

Output that may be requested is the same as that described under Direct Frequency and Random | 
Response. Output for S0LUTI0N points will have the modal coordinates identified by the mode number 
determined in real eigenvalue analysis. 

The eigenvectors used in the modal formulation may be obtained for the S0LUTI0N points by 
using the ALTER feature to print the matrix of eigenvectors following the execution of READ. The 
eigenvectors for all points in the model may be obtained by running the problem initially on the 
Normal Modes Analysis rigid format or by making a modified restart using the Normal Modes Analysis 

rigid format. 

2.11.4 Case Control Deck for Modal Frequency and Random Response 

The following items related to subcase definition and data selection must be considered in 
addition to the list presented with Direct Frequency and Random Response: 

1. METH0D must appear above the subcase level to select an EIGR card that exists in the 
Bulk Data Deck. 

2. All of the eigenvectors used in the modal formulation must be determined in a single 
execution. 

3. An SPC set must be selected above the subcase level unless the model is a free body or 
all constraints are specified on GRID cards, Scalar Connection cards or with General 
Elements. 

4. SDAMPING must be used to select a TABDMP1 table if structural damping is desired. 

2.11.5 Parameters for Modal Frequency and Random Response 

The following parameters are used in Modal Frequency and Random Response: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1.

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

5. LFREQ and HFREQ - required, unless parameter LM0DES is used. The real values of these 
parameters give the cyclic frequency range (LFREQ is the lower limit and HFREQ is the 
upper limit) of the modes to be used in the modal formulation. To use this option, 
parameter LM0DES must be set to 0. 

6. LM0DES - required, unless parameters LFREQ and HFREQ are used. The integer value of 
this parameter' is the number of lowest modes to be used in the modal formulation. 

7. M0DACC - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Dynamic Data 
Recovery module to use the mode acceleration method. Not recommended for use in 
hydroelastic problems. 

8. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

9 - V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 

three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 
10 - WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems.

MODAL TRANSIENT RESPONSE 

2.12.3 Output for Modal Transient Response 

The Eigenvalue Summary Table and the Eigenvalue Analysis Summary, as described under*Normal 
Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.3), are automatically printed. All real eigenvalues extracted are 
included even though not all are used in the modal formulation. 

Output that may be requested is the same as that described under Direct Transient Response. ' 
Output for S0LUTI0N points will have the modal coordinates identified by the mode number determined 
in real eigenvalue analysis. 

The eigenvectors used in the modal formulation may be obtained for the S0LUTI0N points by 
using the ALTER feature to print the matrix of eigenvectors following the execution of READ. The 
eigenvectors for all points in the model may be obtained by running the problem initially on the 
Normal Modes Analysis rigid format or by making a modified restart using the Normal Modes Analysis 
rigid format. 

2.12.4 Case Control Deck for Modal Transient Response 

The following items related to subcase definition and data selection must be considered in 
addition to the list presented with Direct Transient Response: 

1. METH0D must appear above the subcase level to select an EIGR card that exists in the 
Bulk Data Deck. 

2. All of the eigenvectors used in the modal formulation must be determined in a single 
execution. 

3. An SPC set must be selected above the subcase level unless the model is a free body or 
all constraints are specified on GRID cards, Scalar Connection cards or with General 
Elements. 

4. SDAMPING must be used to select a TABDMP1 table if structural damping is desired. 

2.12.5 Parameters for Modal Transient Response 

The following parameters are used in Modal Transient Response: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 



2. 12- 15" (05/ 30/ 86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

5- I START - optional. A positive value of this parameter causes the TRD module to use the 
second (or alternate) starting method (see Section 11.4 of the Theoretical Manual). The 
alternate starting method is recommended when initial accelerations are significant and 
when the mass matrix is non-singular. The default value is -1 and causes the first 
starting method to be used. 

6. LFREQ and HFREQ - required, unless parameter LM0DES is used. The real values of these 
parameters give the cyclic frequency range (LFREQ is the lower limit and HFREQ is the 
upper limit) of the modes to be used in the modal formulation. To use this option, 
parameter LM0DES must be set to 0. 

7. LM0DES - required, unless parameters LFREQ and HFREQ are used. The integer value of 
this parameter is the number of lowest modes to be used in the modal formulation. 

8- M0DACC - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Dynamic Data 
Recovery module to use the mode acceleration method. Not recommended for use in 
hy droe 1: a st.ic p r o b T ems . 

9. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 

two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

10. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

11. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems.

2.12.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for FEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIAG 16 in the Executive Control 'Deck is 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6). 

2.12.7 The APPEND Feature 

The APPEND feature can be used for real eigenvalue extraction in Modal Transient Response. 
See Section 2.3.7 for details. 

2.12.8 The CONTINUE Feature 

The CONTINUE feature can be used for coupled transient analysis in Modal Transient Response. 
See Section 2.9.6 for details. 

2.12.9 Rigid Format Error Messages from Modal Transient Response 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Modal Transient 
Response rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters and is 
followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial action.

2.13.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for FEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIA6 16 in the Executive Control Deck is * 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6). 

2.13.7 The APPEND Feature 

The APPEND feature can be used for real eigenvalue extraction in Normal Modes with 
Differential Stiffness. See Section 2.3.7 for details. 

2.13.8 Rigid Format Error Messages from Normal Modes with Differential Stiffness 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Normal Modes with 
Differential Stiffness rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital 
letters and is followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial 
action. 



NORMAL M0DES WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 1 - N0 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN 
DEFINED. 

No structural elements have been defined with Connection cards. 

N0RMAL M0DES WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 2 - FREE B0DY SUPP0RTS N0T ALL0WED. 

Free bodies are not allowed in Normal Modes with Differential Stiffness. The SUP0RT cards must be 
removed from the Bulk Data Deck and other constraints applied if required for stability. 

N0RMAL M0DES WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 3 - EIGENVALUE EXTRACTION DATA REQUIRED 
F0R REAL EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS. 

Eigenvalue extraction data must be supplied on an EIGR card in the Bulk Data Deck and METH0D in the 
Case Control Deck must select an EIGR set. 

N0RMAL M0DES WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 4 - N0 EIGENVALUE F0UND. 
No eigenvalues were found in the frequency range specified by the user. 

N0RMAL M0DES WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 5 - MASS MATRIX REQUIRED F0R REAL 
EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS. 

The mass matrix is null because either no structural elements were defined with Connection cards, 
nonstructural mass was not defined on a Property card or the density was not defined on a Material 
card. 

N0RMAL M0DES WITH DIFFERENTIAL STIFFNESS ERR0R MESSAGE N0. 6 - N0 INDEPENDENT DEGREES 0F FREED0M 
HAVE BEEN DEFINED. 

Either no degrees of freedom have been defined on GRID, SP0INT or Scalar Connection cards, or all 
defined degrees of freedom have been constrained by SPC, MPC, SUP0RT, 0MIT or GRDSET cards, or 
grounded on Scalar Connection cards.

2.14.3 Output for Static Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry 

The following printed output, for each loading condition and each symmetric segment or * 
index, may be requested for Static Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry: 

1. Displacements and components of static loads and single-point forces of constraint at 
selected grid points or scalar points. 

2. Forces and streses in selected elements. 

3. Scanned output of forces and elements in selected elements. 
The following plotter output may be requested: 

1. Undeformed and deformed plots of the structural model (1 segment). 

2. Contour plots of stresses and displacements (1 segment). 

3. X-Y plot of any component of displacement, static load, or single-point force of 
constraint for a grid point or scalar point. 

4. X-Y plot of any stress or force component for an element. 

2.14.4 Case Control Deck for Static Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Static Analysis 
Using Cyclic Symmetry: 

1. A separate group of subcases must be defined for each symmetric segment. For dihedral 
symmetry, a separate group of subcases must be defined for each half. There may be up 
to 360 subcases corresponding to 1° segments. 

2. The different loading conditions are defined within each group of subcases. The loads 
on each symmetric segment and the selected output requests may be independent. The 
number of loading cases is specified on the PARAM card NL0AD. 

3. The SPC and MPC request must appear above the subcase level and may not be changed. 

4. An alternate loading method is to define a separate group of subcases for each harmonic 
index, k. The parameter CYCI0 is included and the load components for each index are 
defined directly within each group for the various loading conditions. 

2.14.5 Parameters for Static Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry 

The following parameters are used in Static Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry: 
1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2.14-12 (05/30/86) 



STATIC ANALYSIS USING CYCLIC SYMMETRY 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. CTYPE - required. The BCD value of this parameter defines the type of cyclic symmetry 
as follows: 

(1) R0T - rotational symmetry 

(2) DRL - dihedral symmetry, using right and left halves 

(3) DSA - dihedral symmetry, using symmetric and antisymmetric components 

5. CYCI0 - optional. The integer value of this parameter specifies the form of the input 
and output data. A value of +1 is used to specify physical segment representation, and 
a value of -1 for cyclic transform representation. The default value is +1. 

6. CYCSEQ - optional. The integer value of this parameter specifies the procedure for 
sequencing the equations in the solution set. A value of +1 specifies that all cosine 
terms should be sequenced before all sine terms, and a value of -1 specifies alternating 
cosine and sine terms. The default value is -1. 

7. GRDEQ - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter selects the grid point 
about which equilibrium will be checked for the Case Control output request, MPCF0RCE. 
If the integer value is zero, the basic origin is used. The default value is -1. 

8. 6RDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

9. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following the execution of the SSG3 module. 

10. KMAX - optional. The integer value of this parameter specifies the maximum value of the 
harmonic index. The default value is ALL which implies NSEGS/2 for NSEGS even and 
(NSEGS - l)/2 for NSEGS odd. 

11. NL0AD - optional. The integer value of this parameter is the number of static loading 
conditions. The default value is 1. 

12. NSEGS - required. The integer value of this parameter is the number of identical 
segments in the structural model. 

2.14-13 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

13- ,0 PJ - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes both equilibrium and 
multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the Case Control output request, 
MPCF0RCE. A negative integer value of this parameter causes only the equilibrium force 
balance to be calculated for the output request. The default value is which causes 
only the multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the output request. 

14. SURFACE - optional- The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

15. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

16. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the mass matrix are multiplied by the real value of 
this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module.

2.15.3 Output for Normal Modes Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry 

The Eigenvalue Summary Table and the Eigenvalue Analysis Summary, as described under Normal * 
Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.3), are automatically printed. 

Each NASTRAN run calculates modes for only one symmetry index, k. The following output may 
be requested: 

1. Eigenvectors along with the associated eigenvalue for each mode. 

2. Nonzero components of the single-point forces of constraint for selected modes at 
selected grid points. 

3. Forces and stresses in selected elements for selected modes. 

4. Scanned output of forces and elements in selected elements. 
The following plotter output may be requested: 

1. Undeformed plot of the structural model and mode shapes for selected modes. 

2. Contour plots of stresses and displacements for selected modes. 

2.15.4 Case Control Deck for Normal Modes Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Normal Modes 
Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry: 

1. METH0D must be used to select an EIGR card that exists in the Bulk Data Deck. 

2. An SPC set must be selected unless the model is a free body or all constraints are 
specified on GRID cards, Scalar Connection cards or with General Elements. 

3. Multiple subcases are used only to control output requests. A single subcase is 
sufficient if the same output is desired for all modes. If multiple subcases are 
present, the output requests will be honored in succession for increasing mode numbers. 
M0DES may be used to repeat subcases in order to make the same output request for 
several consecutive modes. 

2.15.5 Parameters for Normal Modes Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry 

The following parameters are used in Normal Modes Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

2.15-10 (05/30/86)

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. CTYPE - required. The BCD value of this parameter defines the type of cyclic symmetry 
as follows: 

(1) R0T - rotational symmetry 

(2) DRL - dihedral symmetry, using right and left halves 

(3) DSA - dihedral symmetry, using symmetric and antisymmetric components 

5- CYCSEQ - optional. The integer value of this parameter specifies the procedure for 
sequencing the equations in the solution set. A value of +1 specifies that all cosine 
terms should be sequenced before all sine terms, and a value of -1 specifies alternating 
cosine and sine terms. The default value is -1. 

6 - GRDEQ - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter selects the grid point 
about which equilibrium will be checked for the Case Control output request, MPCF0RCE. 
If the integer value is zero, the basic origin is used. The default value is -1. 

7. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 

Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 

printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 
8 - KINDEX - required. The integer value of this parameter specifies a single value of the 

harmonic index. 
9. NSEGS - required. The integer value of this parameter is the number of identical 

segments in the structural model . 

10. 0PT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes both equilibrium and 
multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the Case Control output request, 
MPCF0RCE. A negative integer value of this parameter causes only the equilibrium force 
balance to be calculated for the output request. The default value is which causes, 
only the multipoint constraint forces to be calculated for the output request. 

11. SURFACE - optional. The computations of the external surface areas for the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they 
are generated in the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this 
parameter. See the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

2.15-11 (05/30/86) 



DISPLACEMENT RIGID FORMATS 

12. V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in * 
the EM6 module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

13. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems. 

2.15.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for FEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIAG 16 in the Executive Control Deck is 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6). 

2.15.7 The APPEND Feature 

The APPEND feature can be used, for real eigenvalue extraction in Normal Modes Analysis Using 
Cyclic Symmetry. See Section 2.3.7 for details. 

2.15.8 Rigid Format Error Messages from Normal Modes Analysis Using Cyclic Symmetry

2.16.3 Output for Static Aerothermoelastic Design/Analysis of Axial-Flow Compressors 

The value of the determinant of the sum of the elastic stiffness and the differential 

stiffness is automatically printed for each differential stiffness loading condition. 

Iterative differential stiffness computations are terminated for one of five reasons. 

Iteration termination reasons are automatically printed in an information message. These reasons '¦ 

have the following meanings: 

1. REASON means the iteration procedure was incomplete at the time of exit. This is 
caused by either an unexpected interruption of the iteration procedure (i.e., system 
abort) or termination is not scheduled (for the other four reasons) at the completion of 
the current iteration. 

2. REASON 1 means the iteration procedure converged to the EPSI0 value supplied by the user 
on a PARAM bulk data card. (The default value of EPSI0 is 1.0E-5.) 

3. REASON 2 means the iteration procedure is diverging from the EPSI0 value supplied by the 
user on a PARAM bulk data card. (The default value of EPSI0 is 1.0E-5.) 

4. REASON 3 means insufficient time remaining to achieve convergence to the EPSI0 value 
supplied by the user on a PARAM bulk data card. (The default value of EPSI0 is 1.0E-5.) 

5. REASON 4 means the number of iterations supplied by the user on a PARAM bulk data card 
has been met. (The default number of iterations is 10.) 

Parameter values at the time of exit are automatically output as follows: 

1. Parameter D0NE: -1 is normal; + N is the estimate of the number of iterations required 
to achieve convergence. 

2. Parameter SHIFT: +1 indicates a return to the top of the inner loop was scheduled; -1 
indicates a return to top of the outer loop was scheduled following the current 
iteration. 

3. Parameter DSEPSI: the value of the ratio of energy error to total energy at the time of 
exit. 

The following output may be requested: 

1. Nonzero Components of the applied static load for the linear solution at selected grid 
points. 

2. Displacements and nonzero components of the single-point forces of constraint, with and 
without differential stiffness, at selected grid points. 

3. Forces and stresses in selected elements, with and without differential stiffness.

1. The Case Control Deck must contain two subcases. 

2. A static loading condition must be defined above the subcase level with a L0AD, 
TEMPERATURE (L0AD), or DEF0RM selection, unless all loading is specified by grid point 
displacements on SPC cards. 

3. An SPC set must be selected above the subcase level unless all constraints are specified 
on GRID cards. 

4. Output requests that apply only to the linear solution must appear in the first subcase. 

5. Output requests that apply only to the solution with differential stiffness must be 
placed in the second subcase. 

6. Output requests that apply to both solutions, with and without differential stiffness, 
may be. placed above the subcase level.

3.1.3 Output for Static Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following output may be requested for Static Heat Transfer Analysis: * 

1. Temperatures (THERMAL) and nonzero components of static loads (0L0AD) and constrained 
heat flow (SPCF0RCE) at selected grid points or scalar points. 

2. The punch option of a THERMAL request will produce TEMP bulk data cards. 

3. Flux density (ELF0RCE) in selected elements. 

4. Plots of the structural model and temperature profiles. 

5. Contour plots of the thermal field. 

3.1.4 Case Control Deck for Static Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Static Heat Transfer 
Analysis: 

1. A separate subcase must be defined for each unique combination of constraints and static 
loads. 

2. A static loading condition must be defined for (not necessarily within) each subcase 
with a L0AD selection, unless all loading is specified with grid point temperatures on 
SPC cards. 

3. An SPC set must be selected for (not necessarily within) each subcase, unless all 
constraints are specified on GRID cards or Scalar Connection cards. 

4. Loading conditions associated with the same sets of constraints should be in contiguous 
subcases, in order to avoid unnecessary looping. 

5. REPCASE may be used to repeat subcases in order to allow multiple sets of the same 
output item. 

3.1.5 Parameters for Static Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Static Heat Transfer Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the HASET output 
data block to be generated by the 6P4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following each execution of the SSG3 module.

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Nonlinear Static 
Heat Transfer Analysis: 

1. A separate subcase must be defined for each unique combination of constraints and 
loading conditions. 

2. An estimated temperature distribution vector must be defined on TEMP cards and selected 
with a TEMP(MATERIAL) request for each subcase. Temperatures for constrained components 
are taken from these TEMP cards and entries on SPC cards are ignored. 

3.2.5 Parameters for Nonlinear Static Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Nonlinear Static Heat Transfer Analysis: 
1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the HASET output 
data block to be generated by the 6P4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 
2 - AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. EPSHT - optional. The real value of this parameter is used to test the convergence of 
the nonlinear heat transfer solution (see Section 8.4.1 of the Theoretical Manual). The 
default value is 0.001. 

4 « IRES - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the printing of the 
residual vectors following the execution of the SSGHT module for each iteration. 

3.2-8 (05/30/86) 



NONLINEAR STATIC HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSIS 

5. MAX IT - optional. The integer value of this parameter limits the maximum number of 

» 
iterations. The default value is 4 iterations. 

6. SIGMA - optional. The real value of this parameter is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 
The default value is 0.0. 

7. TABS - optional. The real value of this parameter is the absolute reference 
temperature. The default value is 0.0.

3.3.3 Output for Transient Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following printed output, sorted by point number or element number (S0RT2), is available 
at selected multiples of the integration time step: 

1. Temperatures (THERMAL) and derivatives of temperatures (VEL0CITY) for a list of PHYSICAL 
points (grid points and extra scalar points introduced for dynamic analysis) or 
SDISPLACEMENT and SVEL0CITY for S0LUTI0N points (points used in the formulation of the 
dynamic equation). 

2. Nonzero components of the applied load vector (0L0AD) and constrained heat flow 
(SPCF0RCE) for a list of PHYSICAL points. 

3. Nonlinear load vector for a list of S0LUTI0N points. 

4. Flux density (ELF0RCE) in selected elements. 
The following plotter output is available: 

1. Plot of the Structural model. 

2. Temperature profiles and thermal contours for selected time intervals. 

3. X-Y plot of temperature or derivative of temperature for a PHYSICAL point or a S0LUTI0N 
point. 

4. X-Y plot of the applied load vector, nonlinear load vector, or constrained heat flow. 

5. X-Y plot of flux density for an element. 

The data used for preparing the X-Y plots may be punched or printed in tabular form (see 
Volume I, Section 4.3). Also, a printed summary is prepared for each X-Y plot which includes the 
maximum and minimum values of the plotted function. 

3.3.4 Case Control Deck for Transient Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Transient Heat 
Transfer Analysis: 

1. One subcase must be defined for each dynamic loading condition. 

2. DL0AD and/or N0NLINEAR must be used to define a time-dependent loading condition for 
each subcase. The static load cards (QVECT, QV0L, QHBDY, QBDY1, and QBDY2) can also be 
used to define a dynamic load by using these cards with, or instead of, the DAREA cards. 
The set identification number on the static load cards (field 2) is used in the same 
manner as the set identification number on the DAREA cards (field 2). 

3. All constraints must be defined above the subcase level. 

3.3-13 (05/30/86) 



HEAT RIGID FORMATS 

4. TSTEP must be used to select the time-step intervals to be used for integration and 

* 
output in each subcase. 

5. If nonzero initial conditions are desired, IC must be used to select a TEMP set in the 
Bulk Data Deck. 

6. An estimated temperature distribution vector must be defined on TEMP cards and selected 
with a TEMP (MATERIAL) request if radiation effects are included. 

7. On restart following an unscheduled exit due to insufficient time, the subcase structure 
should be changed to reflect any completed loading conditions. 

3.3.5 Parameters fo r T ransient Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Transient Heat Transfer Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. BETA - optional. The real value of this parameter is used as a factor in the 
integration algorithm (see Section 8.4.2 of the Theoretical Manual). The default value 
is 0.55. 

4. RADLIN - optional. A. positive integer value of this parameter causes some of the 
radiation efffects to be linearized (see Equation 2, Section 8.4.2 of the Theoretical 
Manual). The default value is -1. 

5. SIGMA - optional. The real value of this parameter is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 
The default value is 0.0. 

6. TABS - optional. The real value of this parameter is the absolute reference 
temperature. The default value is 0.0. 

3.3.6 Rigid Format Error Messages from Transient Heat Transfer Analysis 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP instructions in the Transient Heat 
Transfer Analysis rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters 
and is followed by additional material, including suggestions for remedial action.

4.1.5 Parameters for Blade Cyclic Modal Flutter Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Blade Cyclic Modal Flutter Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4. CTYPE - required. The BCD value of this parameter defines the type of cyclic symmetry 
as follows: 

(1) R0T - rotational symmetry 

(2) DRL - dihedral symmetry, using right and left halves 

(3) DSA - dihedral symmetry, using symmetric and antisymmetric components 

5. CYCSEQ - optional. The integer value of this parameter specifies the procedure for 
sequencing the equations in the solution set. A value of +1 specifies that all cosine 
terms should be sequenced before all sine terms, and a value of -1 specifies alternating 
cosine and sine terms. The default value is -1. 

6. GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

7. IREF - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter defines the reference 
streamline number. IREF must be equal to an SLN on a STREAML2 bulk data card. The 
default value of -1 represents the streamsurface at the blade tip. If IREF does not 
correspond to an SLN, then the default will be taken. 

4.1-18 (05/30/86) 






BLADE CYCLIC MODAL FLUTTER ANALYSIS 

8. KDAMP - optional. An integer value of +1 causes modal damping terms to be put into the 
complex stiffness matrix for structural damping (+1 recommended for K and KE methods). 
The default value is -1. » 

9 - KGGIN - optional. A positive integer of this parameter indicates that the user-supplied 
stiffness matrix is to be read from an external file (GIN0 file INPT) via the INPUTT1 
module in the rigid format. The default value is -1 when not needed. 

10. KINDEX - required. The integer value of this parameter specifies a single value of the 
harmonic index. 

11. LFREQ and HFREQ - required unless parameter LM0DES is used. The real values of these 
parameters give the cyclic frequency range (LFREQ is the lower limit and HFREQ is the 
upper limit) of the modes to be used in the modal formulation. To use this option, 
parameter LM0DES must be set to 0. 

12 > LM0DES - used unless set to 0. The integer value of this parameter is the number of 
lowest modes to be used in the modal formulation. The default value of 999999 will 
result in all modes being used. 

13. L0CATI0N and INPTUNIT - required when using the KGGIN parameter. See Section 5.5 for a 
description of these parameters which are required by the INPUTT1 module. The default 
values for L0CATI0N and INPTUNIT are -1 and 0, respectively. 

14. MAXMACH - optional. The real value of this parameter is the maximum Mach number below 
which the subsonic unsteady cascade theory is valid. The default value is 0.80. 

15. MINMACH - optional. The real value of this parameter is the minimum Mach number above 
which the supersonic unsteady cascade theory is valid. The default value is 1.01. 

16. MTYPE - optional. The BCD value of this parameter controls which components of the 
cyclic modes are to be used in the modal formulation. MTYPE = SINE uses only sine 
components and MTYPE = C0SINE uses only cosine components. The default value is C0SINE. 

17. N0DJE - optional. A positive integer of this parameter indicates that user-supplied 
downwash matrices due to extra points are to be read in from an external file via the 
INPUTT2 module in the rigid format. The default value is -1 when not needed. 

18. NSEGS - required. The integer value of this parameter is the number of identical 
segments in the structural model. 

19. P0SITI0N, UNITNUM an d USRLABEL - required when using the N0DJE parameter. See Section 
5.5 for a description of these parameters which are required by the INPUTT2 module. The 
defaults for P0SITI0N, UNITNUM and USRLABEL are -1, 11 and TAPEID, respectively.

22 - V0LUME - optional. The volume computations for the two-dimensional and 

three-dimensional elements are activated by this parameter when they are generated in 
the EMG module. The results are multiplied by the real value of this parameter. See 
the description under the PARAM bulk data card for details. 

23. VREF - optional. Velocities are divided by the real value of this parameter to convert 
units or to compute flutter indices. The default value is 1.0. 

24. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Mot recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems. 

4.1.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for FEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIAG 16 in the Executive Control Deck is 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6). 

4.1.7 The APPEND Feature 

The APPEND feature can be used for real eigenvalue extraction in Blade Cyclic Modal Flutter 
Analysis. See Section 2.3.7 for details. 

4.1.8 Rigid Format Error Messages from Blade Cyclic Modal Flutter Analysis 

The following fatal errors are detected by the DMAP statements in the Blade Cyclic Modal 
Flutter Analysis rigid format. The text for each error message is given below in capital letters 
and is followed by additional explanatory material, including suggestions for remedial action. 

BLADE FLUTTER ANALYSIS ERR0R N0. 1 - MASS MATRIX REQUIRED F0R M0DAL F0RMULATION. 

The mass matrix is null because either no structural elements were defined with Connection cards, 
nonstructural mass was not defined on a Property card or the density was not defined on a Material 
card.

BLADE CYCLIC MODAL FLUTTER ANALYSIS 

BLADE FLUTTER ANALYSIS ERR0R N0. 2 - EIGENVALUE EXTRACTI0N DATA REQUIRED F0R REAL EIGENVALUE 
ANALYSIS. 

Eigenvalue extraction data must be supplied on an EIGR card in the Bulk Data Deck and METH0D in the 
Case Control Deck must select an EIGR set. 

BLADE FLUTTER ANALYSIS ERR0R N0. 3 - ATTEMPT T0 EXECUTE M0RE THAN 100 L00PS. 

An attempt has been made to use more than 100 flutter loops. This number can be increased by 
ALTERing the REPT instruction following the FA2 module. 

BLADE FLUTTER ANALYSIS ERR0R N0. 4 - REAL EIGENVALUES REQUIRED F0R M0DAL F0RMULATI0N. 
No real eigenvalues were found in the frequency range specified by the user. 

BLADE FLUTTER ANALYSIS ERR0R N0. 5 - N0 GRID P0INT DATA IS SPECIFIED 0R N0 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS HAVE 
BEEN DEFINED. 

No points have been defined with GRID or SP0INT cards or no structural elements have been defined 
with Connection cards. 

BLADE FLUTTER ANALYSIS ERR0R N0. 6 - FREE B0DY SUPP0RTS N0T ALL0WED. 

Free bodies are not allowed in Blade Cyclic Modal Flutter Analysis. The SUP0RT cards must be 
removed from the Bulk Data Deck and other constraints applied if required for stability.

4.2.3 Output for Modal Flutter Analysis 

The real Eigenvalue Summary Table and the real Eigenvalue Analysis Summary, as described ' 
under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.3), are automatically printed. All real eigenvalues 
are included even though all may not be used in the modal formulation. 

The complex eigenvalues are included in the Flutter Summary and are printed for each 
aerodynamic loop. 

The grid point singularities from the structural model are also output. 

A Flutter Summary for each value of the configuration parameters is printed out unless 
PRINT=N0. This shows Mach number, density, reduced frequency, velocity, damping, and frequency for 
each complex eigenvalue. 

V-g and V-f plots may be requested by the XY0UT control cards by specifying the curve type 
as VG. The "points" are loop numbers and the "components" are G or F. 

Printed output of the following types, sorted by complex eigenvalue root number (S0RT1) and 
(m, k, p), may be requested for all complex eigenvalues kept, either as real and imaginary parts or 
as magnitude and phase angle (0° - 360° lead). (Eigenvectors are not available for the KE-method.)

points, and aerodynamic points) or S0LUTI0N points (modal coordinates and extra points). 

2. Nonzero components of the single-point forces of constraint for a list of PHYSICAL 
points. 

3. Complex stresses and forces in selected elements. 

The 0FREQUENCY Case Control card can select a subset of the complex eigenvectors for data recovery. 
In addition, undeformed and deformed shapes may be requested. Undeformed shapes may include only 
structural or structural and aerodynamic elements. 

The eigenvectors used in the modal formulation may be obtained for the analysis points by 
using the ALTER feature to print the matrix of eigenvectors following the execution of READ. The 
eigenvectors for all points in the model may be obtained by running the problem initially on the 
Normal Modes Analysis Rigid Format or by making a modified restart using the Normal Modes Analysis 
Rigid Format.

Analysis: 

1. Only one subcase is allowed. 

2. Desired direct input matrices for stiffness [K pp 3» mass ^ M P p^» and dam P in 9 [B pp ] 
must be selected via the keywords K2PP, M2PP, or B2PP. 

3. CMETH0D must be used to select an EIGC card from the Bulk Data Deck. (K method only.) 

4. FMETH0D must be used to select a FLUTTER card from the Bulk Data Deck. 

5. METH0D must be used to select an EIGR card that exists in the Bulk Data Deck. 

6. SDAMPING must be used to select a TABDMP1 table if structural damping is desired. 

4.2.5 Parameters for Modal Flutter Analysis 

The following parameters are used in Modal Flutter Analysis: 

1. ASET0UT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the ASET output 
data block to be generated by the GP4 module. A negative integer value or suppresses 
the generation of this output data block. The default value is 0. 

2. AUT0SPC - reserved for future optional use. The default value is -1. 

3. C0UPMASS - CPBAR, CPR0D, CPQUAD1, CPQUAD2, CPTRIA1, CPTRIA2, CPTUBE, CPQDPLT, CPTRPLT, 
CPTRBSC - optional. These parameters cause the generation of coupled mass matrices 
rather than lumped mass matrices for all bar elements, rod elements, and plate elements 
that include bending stiffness. 

4 - GRDPNT - optional. A positive integer value of this parameter causes the Grid Point 
Weight Generator to be executed and the resulting weight and balance information to be 
printed. All fluid related masses are ignored. 

5. GUSTAER0 - optional. An integer value of +1 causes gust loads to be computed. The 
default value is -1 for no gust loads. 

6. KDAMP - optional. An integer value of +1 causes modal damping terms to be put into the 
complex stiffness matrix for structural damping (+1 recommended for K and KE methods). 
The default value is -1. 

7. LFREQ and HFREQ - required, unless LM0DES is used. The real values of these parameters 
give the cyclic frequency range (LFREQ is the lower limit and HFREQ is the upper limit) 
of the modes to be used in the modal formulation. To use this option, parameter LM0DES 

must be set to 0. 

4.2-17 (05/30/86) 



AERO RIGID FORMATS 

8. LM0DES - required, unless LFREQ and HFREQ are used. The integer value of this parameter 
is the number of lowest modes to be used in the modal formulation. 

9. MACH - optional. The real value of this parameter selects the closest Mach numbers to 
be used to compute aerodynamic matrices. The default value is 0.0. 

10. N0DJE - optional. A positive integer of this parameter indicates that user-supplied 
downwash matrices due to extra points are to be read from an external file via the 
INPUTT2 module in the rigid format. The default value is -1 when not needed. 

11. PI, P2 and P3 - required when using the N0DJE parameter. See Section 5.5 for a 
description of these parameters which are required by the INPUTT2 module. The default 
values for PI, P2 and P3 are 0, 11 and XXXXXXXX, respectively. 

12 « PRINT - optional. The BCD value, N0, of this parameter suppresses the automatic 
printing of the flutter summary for the K method. The default value is YES. 

13. VREF - optional. Velocities are divided by the real value of this parameter to convert 
units or to compute flutter indices. The default value is 1.0. 

14. WTMASS - optional. The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the real 
value of this parameter when they are generated in the EMA module. Not recommended for 
use in hydroelastic problems. 

4.2.6 Optional Diagnostic Output for PEER 

Special detailed information obtained by requesting DIAG 16 in the Executive Control Deck is 
the same as that described under Normal Modes Analysis (see Section 2.3.6). 

4.2.7 The APPEND Feature 

The APPEND feature can be used for real eigenvalue extraction in Modal Flutter Analysis. See 

Section 2.3.7 for details. 

4.2.8 Rigid Format Error Messages from Modal Flutter Analysis

4.3.4 Case Control Deck for Modal Aeroelastic Response 

The following items relate to subcase definition and data selection for Modal Aeroelastic 
Response: 

1. METH0D must appear above the subcase level to select an eigenvalue extraction method. 

2. At least one subcase must be defined for each unique set of direct input matrices (K2PP, 
M2PP, B2PP) or frequencies. 

3. Consecutive subcases for each set of direct input matrices or frequencies are used to 
define the loading condition - one subcase for each dynamic loading condition. 

4. Constraints must be defined above the subcase level. 

5. DL0AD must be used to define a frequency-dependent loading condition for each subcase. 
If transient loads are selected, a Fourier Transform is used to compute 
frequency-dependent loads. All loads in one run must be of the same type. 

6. FREQUENCY must be used to select one, and only one, FREQ, FREQ1, or FREQ2 card form the 
Bulk Data Deck. If TL0ADs are selected, a TSTEP must be selected. 

7. ^FREQUENCY (0TIME) may be used above the subcase level or within each subcase to select 
a subset of the solution frequencies (times) for output requests. The default is to use 
all solution frequencies (times). 

8. If Random Response calculations are desired, RAND0M must be used to select RANDPS and 
RANDTi cards from the Bulk Data Deck. Only one 0FREQUENCY and FREQUENCY card can be 
used for each set of direct input matrices.
